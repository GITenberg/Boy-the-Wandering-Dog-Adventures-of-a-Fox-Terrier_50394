<span class="cheaderfont">I SEEK AND FIND A FRIEND</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">A few months ago, I came in the course of
my wanderings, to the city of New York. My!
My! how the big city has grown since I was here a
few years ago.</p>

<p>I entered it by way of a ferry-boat from Jersey
City. Then I scampered up past City Hall, the Hotel
de Gink, and the Tombs to the Bowery.</p>

<p>Of course, the first thing was to make a friend. I
chose a solemn-looking bulldog, sitting round the
corner from a saloon whose huge, bulging window
looked like a big eye staring down the street. The
dog, who was brindle in colour, and had a tremendous
head, sat tight up against the wall, and was keeping
a wary eye out for something, I know not what.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” I said politely, and not going
too close to him.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do,” he said morosely. Then he looked
up at the elevated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>That’s the worst of a big city. No dog that’s worth
knowing cares a rap about you, unless you force yourself
on his attention.</p>

<p>“Oh! Come off the L,” I said brusquely.</p>

<p>You see, I recognised at once, that he was a bluff,
matter-of-fact dog who would not appreciate frills.</p>

<p>He did come off, and gave me a glance.</p>

<p>“You’re no fairy,” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“No, and I’m no crazy cur, either,” I replied. “If
I were, you New York dogs would fall all over each
other to entertain me. You’ve got to be either a
beauty, a crank or a millionaire, to get on in this
city.”</p>

<p>“How did you like Virginia?” he asked, with a twist
of his under-jaw.</p>

<p>I’m a pretty self-possessed dog, but I could not
help starting a bit. “How did you know I have been
in Virginia?” I asked sharply.</p>

<p>He gave a snicker. “I know you’re from the South,
for you’re shivering on this mild day, and Virginia
is the nearest state south that has the exact shade of
that lovely red mud sticking to your hind leg.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a Southern dog,” I said hastily.</p>

<p>“You needn’t go out of your way to get hot telling
me that,” he retorted. “You haven’t the slick repose
of manner of the Southern dog.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I’ve struck a four-legged Sherlock
Holmes,” I remarked good-naturedly. “You’re just
the fellow to tell me where to go to get a square
meal.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you trot uptown for your first feed?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he asked with a relaxing of his sour expression, for
he liked being compared to the famous detective.</p>

<p>I smiled. There was no need to say anything, yet I
said it. “Uptown’s fine, after you have an introduction.
Downtown doesn’t ask so many questions.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” he laughed gruffly. “I like you. Come
right in&mdash;I’ll share bones and tit-bits with you for a
night. Follow me,” and he shuffled round the corner
toward the family entrance of the saloon. There he
pushed his flat skull against a door in the wall, and
entered a yard about as big as a pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Not many yards in the Bowery now,” he said
hoarsely. “Happened to be a fire next door that
burnt a building to the ground, and fencing in the
vacant lot, gives us a place to stretch our legs.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” I said. “The city is getting
darker and darker.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied gloomily, “what with burrowing
for the subways, and sky-rocketing for the elevateds,
and tunnelling for the tubes, the city is getting to be
as black as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I said hastily. “I know&mdash;it’s a habitation
not mentioned in polite dog circles.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” he asked in his
choked voice. “If you’re too good for your company,
get out.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” I said hurriedly. “I like you. You’re
a regular sport.”</p>

<p>“I used to be,” he said, settling down on the straw
with a groan, “but my joints&mdash;the rheumatiz has got
me. I’m not like I used to be&mdash;Come on now, reel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
off your life yarn. I’ve got an hour to spare. What’s
your name, and where were you born, and where are
you going?”</p>

<p>“With your powers of observation, you ought to
be able to answer all those questions for yourself,” I
said demurely.</p>

<p>He looked me all over, with his fine dark eyes. “You
haven’t got a name,” he said with a snort, “or rather
you have many names. You’re a travelling dog. You
were born anywhere, and you don’t know where you’re
going.”</p>

<p>I burst into such a delighted yell of laughter that
he told me to shut up, or some one might hear us.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” I asked wonderingly.
“And what’s the matter with all the dogs here?
I never saw such a cowed looking set.”</p>

<p>“We’re listening for the cops,” he said angrily.
“We’ve got a new health commissioner and he’s
a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I interjected hurriedly, “a dear fellow.
He doesn’t understand dogs probably.”</p>

<p>“Understand them&mdash;he’s a fool. He says it’s the
citizens first, if every dog has to go. He’s muzzled
every one of us, even when led on a leash. He wants
to make little old New York a dogless city.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s the old rabies scare,” I said.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;that’s it. A poor dog loses his master. He
runs wild and howls. A crowd chases him, and he
foams at the mouth. Then they kill him. Rabies!&mdash;rats!”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” I said, “we’re dogs of course, but let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
us look at the human point of view. There is such a
disease.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is, but it’s as rare as a summer’s day
in winter. You’ve as much chance of being struck by
lightning, as of being bit by a mad dog.”</p>

<p>“Yet there are people killed by lightning,” I said.</p>

<p>He was grumbling on to himself. “The Lord made
dogs&mdash;Man can’t improve ’em. He gave us our
mouths free to chew grass and pick a little earth for
stomach troubles. You muzzle a dog, and he gets sick
and makes his master sick. The fool commissioner
hurts the humans more than he helps them.”</p>

<p>“But he’s trying to wipe out the disease,” I said.
“There isn’t much of it, and if the dogs are muzzled
for a few years, it will be stamped out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll have a dozen other worse diseases
by that time. A muzzled dog is a menace to his master,
I tell you. Let ’em supervise our health in some
way. Let the government do as much for us as they
do for pigs. Then we wouldn’t hear of rabies. The
commissioner’s a fool&mdash;New York’s rotten anyway.”</p>

<p>I didn’t dare to disagree with him, for he probably
would have nabbed me. “Well,” I said humbly, “I
suppose we must let them come first.”</p>

<p>“Who come first?” he growled.</p>

<p>“Human beings&mdash;we’re second.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he assented.</p>

<p>“Now for the sake of human beings,” I went on,
“who are as closely packed together as they are in New
York, there shouldn’t be many animals in with them.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said, “I’m with you there. High license<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to keep dogs down. They’re not happy themselves if
they’re cramped.”</p>

<p>“But high license is against the poor man,” I said.
“He could not afford to keep a dog for his children.”</p>

<p>“Let him go without,” said the bulldog.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not in these days of equality. How about
having public playgrounds in crowded districts, with
bird and animal pets, and a house with a caretaker to
supervise the play of the children.”</p>

<p>“They have such playgrounds now,” he said.</p>

<p>“But, they haven’t any dogs, and cats and birds.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “let ’em have ’em, if you can
get the dough.”</p>

<p>“And furthermore,” I continued, “let the city give
the superintendence of animals and birds to a person
who understands them.”</p>

<p>The old dog was pleased now. “That’s right,” he
said, “I’m with you there. Don’t boss a job you don’t
understand.”</p>

<p>“From what you say,” I went on, “it sounds as if
your commissioner was very hygienic, but he has got
the bull by the tail instead of by the horns.”</p>

<p>The old dog roared with delight. This was something
along his own line, and seeing him so good-natured,
I was emboldened to say: “You spoke in
quite a religious way just now, yet you keep a saloon.”</p>

<p>He turned on me quite fiercely. “Do you suppose
there’s no religion in a saloon? I tell you there’s more
good-nature and help-your-neighbourliness down here
in the Bowery than there is up on Fifth Avenue. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
told you to come down here for a free feed, hey?&mdash;You,
a classy dog.”</p>

<p>“But is that religion?” I asked hesitatingly, for I
didn’t want to ruffle the old fellow and lose my dinner.</p>

<p>“It’s the new theology,” he said more agreeably.
“We don’t go to church, and sing hymns, and make
roly-poly eyes, but we buck each other up. Why my
mister sells the best of the Little Hell Gate Distillery
stuff, yet if a fellow has too many drinks in him, he
doesn’t get another one from us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said easily, “I try to be an up-to-date dog,
and the latest theory is that drink takes strength away.
First thing I noticed arriving here was the procession
of saloons. First thing I noticed in the South was
their absence. It had a kind of too-good-to-be-true
look.”</p>

<p>“I see Russia gets on better without the sale of
vodka,” said my new friend agreeably. “I guess we’d
do just as well on the water-wagon, but you don’t
want to be too quick in hopping on it. I often think
that some of these fellows who come in here so dry
and grabbing for their drinks, would be just as well
off if they had a lot of good old hot coffee, the kind
mother used to make; but you’d have to go slow with
’em, about putting the coffee-pot in the place of the
bottle.”</p>

<p>“I never can understand,” I said, “why men don’t
like grape-juice, and ginger ale, and beer, and all kinds
of nice, cool, sloppy drinks better than fiery stuff, but
that’s been tried and they hate it.”</p>

<p>A cunning gleam came in the old dog’s eyes. “Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
folk don’t understand. They make their health
places too clean and shiny, and a man in overalls
don’t want to get in the eye of the public to take
his drink and swap yarns with another pair of overalls.
I’ll tell you what my mister’s doing, if you
won’t let on to the dogs round here. They’re a tonguey
bunch.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I replied.</p>

<p>The old dog thrust his head out of his kennel, to
see if any one was listening, then he went on. “It’s this
way. Mister goes up town or down town to some
saloon&mdash;say Jones’. Says he, ‘How much do you clean
up <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>, Jones?’ Jones says, ‘A thousand dollars.’
Mister asks, ‘How much will you sell for?’
Jones tells him. Mister either buys him out, or goes
in as a partner. Same old business goes on, same old
stand, same old boss. Coffee runs in, liquor runs out,
and before Jones’ pack know where they are, naughty
drinks are out, and pious ones are in&mdash;and mister makes
more dough.”</p>

<p>“Good thought,” I exclaimed. “I suppose if he’d
shut up the old place, and put up a temperance sign
at first, the men would have run like deer.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the old dog, “drive folks, and they
run from you; coax ’em, and they feed out of your
hand.”</p>

<p>“Is your master going to make this saloon into a
good one?” I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Mebbe, in time. This gives him his title of saloon-keeper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your master must be a queer man,” I said. “I’d
like to see him.”</p>

<p>“You never saw his match,” chuckled the old dog.
“He could make money out of the cobble stones.”</p>

<p>“Is he rich?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“I should smile.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I’m glad to hear he’s a semi-philanthropist.”</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;just spell that word, will you?” said my
friend with mock politeness. I spelt it for him, then
he said, “Were you ever a preacher’s dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “and he was a fine fellow.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever a saloon-keeper’s dog?” he went
on with a twinkle in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said with a laugh, for I rejoiced to see
how keen he was.</p>

<p>Before I left the South, I had to associate with
coloured dogs for a time, and while they were kindness
itself, they were not quick-witted like the white
dogs.</p>

<p>“I guess you were an actor’s dog too, weren’t you?”
continued old Gringo, for I had seen his name over his
kennel.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I was.”</p>

<p>“And a grocer’s dog, and a milkman’s dog, and a
doctor’s dog, and a postman’s dog, and a thousand
ladies’ dog, and in short you’re a very&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I said hastily, “I’ve boxed the compass,
as far as owners go.”</p>

<p>He burst into a hoarse laugh. “I guess the human
race ain’t got any string on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” I said modestly, “I know considerable about
men and women.”</p>

<p>“And children?” he said.</p>

<p>“No,” I returned. “It isn’t so easy to follow them.
They’re so clever, so very much more unexpectedly
clever than the grown-ups.”</p>

<p>“It’s a doll-fashion now to kow-tow to young ones,”
he said crossly. “I don’t like ’em myself, except a
few.”</p>

<p>I suppressed a yawn. I was powerfully hungry, and
so far, not a word had been said about dinner.</p>

<p>Suddenly my new friend trembled. “Down on your
knees,” he whispered. “Waller in the straw. Keep
cool&mdash;&mdash;” then he filled up the kennel door with the
stout, muscular breadth of his body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">I LOSE MY FRIEND</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Here, dog-catcher,” shrilled an impish young
voice. “Here’s the kennel where the strange
dog ran in. I saw him. He hadn’t a collar on.”</p>

<p>I scarcely dared breathe. Some Bowery imp had
seen me, and reported me to the police.</p>

<p>“Gringo,” said an unusually resonant man’s voice,
“come out. We’re going to raid your kennel.”</p>

<p>Gringo told me afterward he gave his master a wink.
Anyway, when the deep voice sounded again, it was to
a different tune.</p>

<p>“Officer,” it said carelessly, “do you think a strange
dog would get by that face?”</p>

<p>“No I don’t,” said a policeman’s voice. “Run home,
young one, and when you dream again, don’t call me.”</p>

<p>“What are you givin’ me?” asked the imp’s voice,
and I knew by the twang it was a girl imp. “Gringo’s
foolin’ you. He’s the soft dog in the heart spot.
See me ram my fist down his throat.”</p>

<p>Gringo told me afterward it was as good as a play
to see the cop’s face when impie ran her thin young
arm in between his rat-trap jaws. Of course he had
to bite her gently. There was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>The young one in a rage, smashed him in the face.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“There’s one for you, you old bluffer. You never bit
me before. Keep your old dog&mdash;I don’t care, but I’m
on to him when he makes his exit.”</p>

<p>Gringo was shaking with laughter, when they all
went away. “There’s a long feather in your cap,” he
said.</p>

<p>“A feather I could have done without,” I replied
ruefully. “It means I must skedaddle.”</p>

<p>“Not without your dinner,” he said kindly, and he
started to shuffle toward the back door of the red brick
house. “Bark twice, if the angel re-appears,” he said
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Thank fortune she did not, and soon Gringo returned,
carrying his food dish between his huge jaws.
He set the dish in front of the kennel.</p>

<p>“I often feed here,” he said under his breath. “Take
what I chuck you. The angel has her eye at a crack
in the fence.”</p>

<p>As he ate, he carelessly tossed into the kennel, toast
scraps soaked in nice chicken gravy, and some delicious
steak bones with the tenderest part of the meat clinging
to them. What a good dinner I had! But I was
nearly choked with thirst.</p>

<p>I told him about my parched throat, when he finished
his dinner, and came into the kennel.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait,” he said, “till the angel folds
her wings. She’s the cleverest young one on the
Bowery. Usually I like her, but to-night I wish she
was in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I said, “in bed. Well, she’ll have to go
soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor kid. She has no mother,” said the old dog,
“and her aunt spoils her.”</p>

<p>That young one stayed at the fence crack for exactly
one hour. She was determined to prove she was right.
Before she went away, she called viciously, “I’ve got
to beat it, Gringo, so tell your friend to take a starlight
saunter to some other place in this burg. I’m goin’ to
make this place too hot to hold him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He said nothing, and I observed irritably, “Usually
girls like dogs.”</p>

<p>“She’s wild for them,” observed Gringo. “Don’t
you catch on? She’s mad because she didn’t get her
own way, and because I went back on her.”</p>

<p>“But why did she report me, in the first place?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Because she was hanging round here, hoping to
get a glimpse of you. I gave her a black look when
she came too near, and it crossed her temper. She
was bound to get even with me. I should have let
her see you. Then she’d have helped you. She treats
dogs like Christians.”</p>

<p>“Pagans for me then,” I said. “I think I’ll be
going.”</p>

<p>“<a href="#Fig_24">You must have a drink first,” said Gringo hospitably</a>.
“Follow me.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the saloon&mdash;to the tub where
they washed the glasses. The water was rather fiery,
but I didn’t care, for I was exceedingly thirsty. He
invited me to stay till later, but I said, “No.” I wanted
to get away, while there were still plenty of people in
the streets.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re leaner than I am, you can slip between
folks,” he said. “I never could hide my bulk. Still
you’re white&mdash;that’s dead against you. How do you
get over that in your travels?”</p>

<p>“It’s a great handicap,” I replied, “except when I’m
hiding against something light. But it’s wonderful how
one can overcome disadvantages.”</p>

<p>“You’re smart,” he said with a snort. “I guess
you’d get on anyway. Call again, some time.”</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly for his hospitality, scurried
down the side street, then round by another winding
one to the Bowery! Oh! those narrow streets! Rich
people have the ugly things at the backs of their
houses. These poor people had the fire-escapes and
clothes lines in front. No room at the back. Poor
wretches&mdash;they even hadn’t air enough. I could smell
the foulness of it. No wonder they get tuberculosis
of the brain.</p>

<p>I dashed back to the Bowery which was airy and
comfortable compared with these side streets. Then I
mingled with the crowd on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>For weeks I had been living in a small town, and
this seemed like old times, for I am a city dog born
and bred. I love the fields and the forests for a time,
but for week in and week out, give me the pavements
and lots of excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>An English greyhound taught me that, one summer
when I was in London, with a dearly loved mistress
who afterward married a man who hated dogs.</p>

<p>Well, to come back to the Bowery. It was a fine
night, and everybody was out but the cripples. Oh,
what a forest of little feet and big feet, and pretty feet
and ugly feet, and good feet and wicked feet. I trotted
among them, moralising just as hard as I could.</p>

<p>Feet have as much character as faces. Show me
a pair of shoes with the ankles in them, and I’ll tell
you what kind of a headpiece crowns the structure.</p>

<p>For a while, I ran beside a nice little pair of stout,
black, walking shoes. They had been patched, but
the blacking on them shone over the patch. There
were neat, darned stockings in the shoes, above them
the trim circle of a serge skirt, then, on account of the
crowd, I could see no more. But I knew a tidy young
girl walked in those shoes, and her brother must have
approved of her, for if a boy goes walking with his
sister at night, she must be a pretty nice girl. They
were going to a moving picture show, and were debating
what they should buy for their sick mother with
the ten cents that would be left. Finally they decided
on grape fruit.</p>

<p>The boy had stocky feet encased in heavy boots that
had not been bought this side of the Atlantic. I listened
to the rich brogue of the boots, and found it was Irish.
When the great yellow and red mouth of a moving
picture palace swallowed up shoes and owners, I
sidled up to another pair in the throng.</p>

<p>Oh! what a little witch this girl was&mdash;dirty, light-topped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
French-heeled shoes, wiggly, frayed skirt edge,
silly walk&mdash;she kept lopping over against her partner,
a lad who was parading the damp streets in thin-soled,
shoddy shoes about as substantial as paper. I couldn’t
stand their idiotic talk. I left them, paddled up to
Forty-second Street, and ran across it to Broadway.</p>

<p>I noted that many more electric lights have been
put up since I was here last. The Great White Way
has more than a thousand eyes now, and the pavements
were rather lighter than I liked them.</p>

<p>I lifted my paws daintily, feeling as if I were walking
on mirrors. However, the mirrors were mostly
obscured&mdash;what crowds of hurrying, restless human
beings surging to and fro, meeting, clashing, avoiding,
closing, opening&mdash;just like waves of the sea.</p>

<p>I had no need to keep out of sight of the policemen
here. They were fully occupied with the human waves
which sometimes leaped over and by them, in spite of
the warning hand that would keep them from being
dashed to pieces by the street traffic.</p>

<p>I paused to take breath round the corner of a street.</p>

<p>“Say, those policemen have a hard time,” I remarked
to a black cat who had come out to take the air, and
was blotted against a dark spot in a wall. She wasn’t
a bit afraid of me.</p>

<p>“Everybody has a hard time in New York,” she
said gloomily, “and if one human goes under the
wheels, the rest show their teeth at the cop.”</p>

<p>“That’s mean,” I observed.</p>

<p>“Everything’s mean here,” she said. “It’s a hideous
place for cats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know there were any cats on Broadway,”
I said.</p>

<p>“There aren’t many,” she replied. “I come from
Sixth Avenue,” and she gave a backward tilt to her
head.</p>

<p>I sat and panted, and she went on bitterly, “You
dogs don’t know what life is for us cats. You are
led out for exercise, and you get it, even if your head
is in a muzzle. They take you to the parks. If we
crawl out, we can’t get beyond the curbstone. Just
think of life without the touch of earth and grass to
your paws. Everything paved and stony. I wish I
was dead.”</p>

<p>“Some cats go on the roofs,” I said. “I’ve seen
them.”</p>

<p>“A roof is glary and there’s no earth there,” she
said, “and no one to play with. Cats shouldn’t be
allowed in big cities. Look at my face&mdash;all broke
out with mange.”</p>

<p>“Do you get enough to eat?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“Too much,” she said gloomily. “I belong to an
eating-house. I’m supposed to catch mice, but I don’t.
I just dream.”</p>

<p>“What do you dream about?” I asked.</p>

<p>Her face grew quite handsome. “I dream of a little
cottage with a garden and a kind old woman.”</p>

<p>“Are you a stolen cat?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said miserably. “I come from Mount
Vernon way. These folks here were automobiling a
few weeks ago, and wanting a cat, stole me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you run home?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“All that way&mdash;up toward Harlem and the Bronx&mdash;I’m
scared.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” I said, “tell me your address. Maybe
some day I can do something for you.”</p>

<p>“The Lady Gay eating-house,” she said, “but there’s
precious little gaiety about it.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up,” I said, “I haven’t a home myself, and
I’ve had lots of trouble, and I’m going to have more,
but I never give up.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” she asked curiously.</p>

<p>I began to laugh. “I wish I knew. I’m looking for
a home.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite a nobby dog,” she said looking me
over. “I suppose our eating-house wouldn’t suit you.”</p>

<p>“Now mind,” I said warningly, “I’m not stuck-up.
I love all kinds of people, but for choice give me the
rich. They’re so clean, and have so many comforts.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” she said bitterly. “I wish
I had your pluck. I’d like to go home-seeking too.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” I said with a laugh. “I’ll take
you.”</p>

<p>She shrank back against the wall, till she looked like
a pancake, and drew in her breath. “I’d never dare.”</p>

<p>“If you never dare, you never accomplish anything,”
I said.</p>

<p>“But even if I dared,” she said persistently, “how
could a cat get through these crowded streets, away up
to Mount Vernon?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” I said, “but in your case, I’d
do something. There’s always a way out of trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well now, just suppose you’re a cat, and in my
place, what would you do?”</p>

<p>“Do those people who stole you, ever motor back
in that same direction?”</p>

<p>“Often&mdash;it makes me crazy to hear them talk about
the lovely times they have spinning along from village
to village, and town to town.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you sneak into the automobile some
day when they’re going out, and hide till they get
somewhere near your old home. They’d be sure to
go in somewhere for a drink, then you could steal
out, and make a bolt for your old woman and the
cottage.”</p>

<p>“There’s no place to hide in the car,” she said.
“They’d discover me.”</p>

<p>“Well then, start out some night, and take the journey
in relays. A strong young cat could run miles in
a night. By morning, you’d be away from the crowded
district.”</p>

<p>“But where would I get my breakfast?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh fudge!” I replied. “I see you’re one of those
cautious cats that want every step of the way checked
out. You’ve got to rely a little on your own initiative,
to get on in this world.”</p>

<p>She showed some temper at this, and said snappishly,
“I can’t change myself. I’m made timid.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got to trust to luck or to a friend.”</p>

<p>“Will you help me?” she said pitifully.</p>

<p>She was a perfect goose of a cat, still I couldn’t
help feeling sorry for her. “I’ll give you some advice,”
I said. “Stop eating meat, and take more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
exercise. You’re too young a cat to have mange.”</p>

<p>“I do take exercise,” she said. “I come here every
night, and watch the folks.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that exercise?” I said disdainfully.
“Why, that’s nothing. You should run back and forth
for hours. Come in here through this door into this
courtyard. I’ll show you how.”</p>

<p>My paws were beginning to get pretty sore by this
time, for I had run far that day. However, I notice
I always have bad luck, if I don’t stop to help some
lame dog or cat over a stile. So I leaped and gambolled
round that dark courtyard, and made her do
likewise, till her lugubriousness had all faded away.</p>

<p>“I declare I feel like ten cats all rolled in one,”
she said holding her head up, and mewing gratefully.</p>

<p>“Now you just come here every night and do this,”
I said, “and cut the meat out of your bill-of-fare. Hope
on, and if you can’t do anything for yourself, and if
I get a good billet, I’ll do something for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what will you do?” she mewed anxiously, as
she followed me back to Broadway.</p>

<p>“How can I tell, my friend,” I replied. “I’m a dog
that acts on impulse. Good-bye, and good luck to
you.”</p>

<p>“So long,” she said sweetly. “You’ve brought me
hope and cheer. Oh! do come soon again.”</p>

<p>I laughed, and tossed my head as I left her. Who
could tell when we should meet again? “You spruce
up, and do something for yourself,” I called back.
“You’re the best friend you’ve got. Remember that.”</p>

<p>I travelled up Broadway for a while, in a brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
study. What a pity that so many of us like the city.
The country is certainly better for us. Why didn’t I
stay in lovely old Virginia?</p>

<p>Ah! why didn’t I? And I snickered to myself, as I
dashed out into the street for a run. We like crowds,
and music, and excitement. We like to be pushed, and
hurried, and worried; and have funny things and adventurous
things, and dreadful things happen. There’s
nothing in the world that some human beings and
some dogs hate as much as being bored, and that’s
what takes us to the cities, and keeps us there till
we’re exhausted, and go to the country to recuperate.</p>

<p>But wouldn’t it be possible to have the country made
more attractive, I wondered. I’ve heard human beings
talk about good roads, and more telephones, and theatres,
and moving pictures and churches open all the
time, like some of these New York churches where
you can go in and rest. More city in the country and
more country in the city&mdash;that would suit everybody.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes wide when I got to Seventy-second
Street. Why, I thought I was down town. How the
traffic has moved up!</p>

<p>Broadway got quieter, and cleaner, and broader, as
I ran like a fox along the wide pavement. Here was
more danger of being seen by a policeman. Two did
see me, and one gave chase and threw his club; but I
laughed between my paws, and ran on. Let him catch
me if he could.</p>

<p>Old Broadway looked fine. There are huge apartment
houses where there used to be nothing at all, or
else contingents of fair-sized houses squatting along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the way, waiting for something to turn up. Now
these sky-scraping apartment houses have come in
battalions, rearing their lofty heads with their rob-my-neighbour
air. There’s something powerfully
mean about them, in spite of their good looks. The
health commissioner had better get after them, for
they steal air and light from all the little houses, and
do more harm than we dogs do.</p>

<p>At last I turned toward Riverside Drive. Ah! here
was something I liked best of all&mdash;plenty of air and
light, and the grand old Hudson as sparkling and
handsome as ever. I had to jump up on one of the
iron seats to look at it, on account of the stone wall.
I think a city river, flowing smoothly between houses
full of pleasure or trouble, and flashing back their
myriad lights, is one of the most soothing sights in
the world.</p>

<p>I love the Hudson, and the Thames, and the Seine
and many other rivers, and next to them I love the
bays, but they are mostly too big to love. It’s the
little things that creep next us.</p>

<p>Well, the Hudson looked all right outside, but I
hear the fishes are giving it an awful name inside. In
fact, no respectable fish comes now within miles of
New York.</p>

<p>Riverside Drive is grand with its fine houses, and
its breadth and open park spaces. I began to sing
a little song to myself as I ran past the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ monument, “Who’ll take poor doggie in for
the night?”</p>

<p>I had struck the regular dog and baby district by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
this time. Both kinds of pets flourish on Riverside
Drive. The babies had all gone to bed, but lots of
little boy and girl dogs were taking the air. The most
of them were led by maids or men-servants, and a few
by their fond owners. Here and there one scampered
about, trying to look gay and careless in spite of his
sobering muzzle, which made me think of Gringo and
his health commissioner.</p>

<p>I often think what a lot of trouble human beings
take for us dogs. I’ve seen men and women yawning
with fatigue, exercising their dogs at night. They
know we love them&mdash;that is, some of them do. There’s
a powerful lot of dog affection wasted on owners who
don’t understand dogs, and never take them out with
them. Upon my word, my heart has ached to see the
pitiful, beseeching glances some dogs give their masters
and mistresses, as if saying, “Do like us a little&mdash;we
just adore you.”</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to me, as I stared at the
various dogs disporting themselves on the Drive. I
must get a collar off one of them. I fixed my eye on
a young but horribly bloated Boston terrier with a
white face who was wearing a collar too large for
him. He hadn’t any neck worth speaking of. Now,
<a href="#Fig_Frontispiece">I am an open-faced, wire-haired fox terrier</a>, and my
neck was not nearly as large as this bloated fellow’s.
I stalked him for three blocks, till he got skittish,
and throwing up his head, left the maid he had been
following so closely, and started out by himself for a
run in the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood holding his muzzle in her hand, and keeping
a keen look-out for policemen.</p>

<p>I stole after him, grabbed his collar with my teeth,
slipped my own head in it, and ran like a purse-snatcher
with a policeman after him.</p>

<p>Mr. Boston gave an angry roar, but I knew the maid
would take care of him, so I loped easily along and forgot
about them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">I FIND A SECOND FRIEND</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">I still kept to the Drive, and trotted along well
up into the hundredth streets. My plan was to
have some one find me with the collar on, which undoubtedly
had an address on it&mdash;but I must not be
found near enough to Mr. Boston’s home to be returned
that night, for I might be ignominiously turned
out into the darkness of the street.</p>

<p>Now for another poor person. If a rich one found
me, into an automobile or a taxi would I go, and
presto!&mdash;the house of the indignant dog I had robbed.</p>

<p>I am not defending my action. I was a naughty,
mischievous dog to steal another dog’s collar. I
might even be called a thief, but for the fact that I
intended to return the collar with me inside it, when
I trusted to my native wit to do the rest.</p>

<p>I had better leave the west side, and turn toward
the east. I dashed up the hill past the Home for Incurables,
made for the big College of New York that
I remembered from my former visit, slipped down the
slope behind it, and found myself in the kind of district
I wanted.</p>

<p>Here was a nice unfashionable avenue&mdash;New York
certainly has a great number of wide streets&mdash;plenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of noise, and many people walking about, lots of well-lighted
shops with everything under the sun in them,
and a good many persons with kind faces.</p>

<p>I avoided the very young, the very old&mdash;there
weren’t many of these, anybody that was too gay or
too dull, or too dirty and poor-looking. I wouldn’t
mind poor people so much, if they would keep clean.
The most of them are so careless in their personal
habits, that no self-respecting dog wants to live with
them.</p>

<p>I chose a respectable-looking coloured woman who
was coming out of a nice-looking meat shop. Her
shoes were bright and neat, and by the look of her
hands, I judged she was a washerwoman. She had
been out working by the day, and she was going to have
a good hot meat supper in which I would join her.</p>

<p>Sidling close up to her, I whined gently and held
up a beseeching paw.</p>

<p>She gazed down at me with a lovely benevolent expression.
“Why, doggie,” she said, “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>I squeezed a little closer, and licked her clean, cotton
dress.</p>

<p>I am not considered really beautiful, but I am a very
well-bred dog, and most women say I have a nice way
with me when I choose.</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow,” she said, “I believe you’re
lost, and I just happened to see you.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything to this, though I might have
told her that most things are arranged. They don’t
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“But perhaps you knew me,” she went on. “Maybe
I’ve worked for the lady that owns you.”</p>

<p>Maybe she had. I didn’t know.</p>

<p>“And you smelt my tracks and followed me,” she
continued. “I’ve heard that some dogs are mighty
clever. Bless your little heart. You want me to take
you to your home. Come right along with Ellen, and
we’ll telephone to the address I see on your collar.
I’ve just got a nickel left.”</p>

<p>I felt badly to have her spend money on me, still
it does us all good to be benevolent&mdash;dogs and human
beings too&mdash;so I said nothing, and followed her to the
telephone booth in a drug store.</p>

<p>I thought I would die laughing to hear her telephoning.
“Is this Riverside twenty twenty?” she asked.</p>

<p>Yes, it was.</p>

<p>“Oh! ma’am, I’ve found your dog.”</p>

<p>Of course I couldn’t hear the other side of the conversation,
but I guessed what it was. When she said,
“But your name is on the collar,” I listened anxiously
for the next.</p>

<p>“But,” said my nice coloured woman, “doesn’t the
collar go with the dog?”</p>

<p>Something else followed, then my Ellen said, “I did
notice it was too big for him. It’s way down over his
shoulders. What do you say?”</p>

<p>A long silence came after this. Ellen was listening
intently. Finally she hung up the receiver, and
looked down at me with a mystified air. “Poor lady&mdash;she
seems all upset. She said something about a dog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thief’s dog, and a collar being stolen. Perhaps she
has two dogs.”</p>

<p>Perhaps she is going to have, I thought, but of
course I said nothing.</p>

<p>“We’ll go see her in the morning,” said Ellen. “I
have to work near there, and now we’ll go home, and
have some supper.”</p>

<p>I was not too tired to jump up, and lick her kind,
old fingers. Then she led the way to her home, which
was in an apartment-house on this same broad avenue.
We tugged up six flights of stairs, and while we were
going up she said, “I s’pose you’ve been accustomed
to elevators, little dog. Poor folks can’t have all the
nice things the rich have.” There was nothing to be
said to this, except to give her silent sympathy, and
stand back while she unlocked her door, and let herself
into a neat little set of rooms. She had two bed-rooms
and a kitchen, and her son, who was a sidewalk
usher in a fashionable hotel, lived with her.</p>

<p>The tiny kitchen was cute. It had a gas stove, a
table, two rocking-chairs and two windows. It was
just big enough to turn round in. The son, Robert Lee,
came up the stairs just after we did, and she hastened
to tell him my story.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily, throwing back his head, and
showing every tooth he possessed&mdash;those teeth of negroes
aren’t as white as they look. It’s the contrast
of their dark skin that makes them seem to have
whiter teeth than white people.</p>

<p>He slipped the collar off my neck, and laid it on a
shelf. “It’s a bull-terrier’s collar,” he said, “and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fellow is a fox-terrier, and ought to have a narrower
one. I know, ’cause I see the rich folks’ dogs at the
hotel. Some one has slipped the wrong collar on this
fellow. Yes, take him to that address in the morning.
Maybe there’ll be a reward.”</p>

<p>This pleased me, and I licked his nice, dark hands.
Then we had a dandy supper, and I had a good long
drink of fresh water&mdash;my favourite beverage. I don’t
care much for milk. While Ellen washed the dishes,
Robert Lee sat in one of the rocking-chairs and played
on his banjo while he sang to her about “Mighty Lak
a Rose,” and “I Want to Go to Tokio,” and “I
Didn’t Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier.”</p>

<p>After a while, he put away his banjo, and we all
went to bed.</p>

<p>I slept on the old coloured woman’s couch. She
started me on a piece of carpet by the gas stove, but
as soon as she was asleep, I sneaked up and lay beside
her feet. I saw no earthly reason why I should not
do so. I had licked my paws quite clean, and I had no
fleas, and I loved a comfortable bed high up, and hated
a draughty floor.</p>

<p>In the morning very early, for charwomen must
work, while ladies sleep, my nice Ellen got up, roused
her son who was sleeping the pig sleep of all healthy
young males, and prepared a nice, smelly breakfast&mdash;bacon
and warmed-over sausage, and two fried eggs,
and hot rolls and perfectly scrumptious coffee with
real cream from a bottle outside the window.</p>

<p>Rich people say that working people don’t live
well. Poor people that have brains enough to work,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
can live well if they choose, and they mostly do choose.
I think they have lots more fun than rich people. They
don’t whine and snarl so much, and they laugh harder
and oftener, and cry louder and longer.</p>

<p>Ellen would have been frightfully bored on Riverside
Drive, or Fifth or Park Avenues. She was one
of the happiest women I ever saw, and Robert Lee, her
son, whistled all the time. He had a good mother, and
a nice molasses shade of girl whose picture he carried
in his heart pocket, and he had good wages and plenty
to eat, and no enemies, and he didn’t drink, and he
had no heavy social duties.</p>

<p>Well, Ellen had her three cups of coffee, and I had
a perfectly stunning feed; then Robert Lee went to
do his sidewalk posing in front of his hotel, and finally,
about eight o’clock, we took a cross-town street and
walked toward Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>I love interesting situations, and it nearly tickled
me to death to imagine what was going to happen.
Poor old Ellen was so pleased in what she called my
pleasure in going home. Some dogs would have run
away before they would have faced the lady who
thought me the dog of a thief, but I trusted to luck
and pressed on.</p>

<p>Ellen had too much sense to put a string on me. I
jumped and frisked about her, and that young Boston
bull’s collar swung and twisted about my neck. By
the way, it was a very valuable collar, with fine imitation
turquoises in it.</p>

<p>Finally we emerged upon the Drive. The Hudson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was more glorious in the morning sunlight than it
had been in the starlight of the night before.</p>

<p>Poor Ellen, I thought to myself, here is a chance to
whine. These rich people have everything&mdash;the big
houses, the fine river, the view of the hills and trees
over in New Jersey, but will she complain?&mdash;Not a
bit of it. Ellen doesn’t care for scenery, and she finds
the Drive windy. She likes her snug, warm rooms,
and the neighbours of her own position in life.</p>

<p>We entered a specially grand apartment-house with
a marble entrance, and plenty of mirrors and palms,
and we went up in the elevator to the seventh story.
Ellen pressed a bell, and a maid with her cap over one
ear opened the door.</p>

<p>She stared at us, and said no one was up.</p>

<p>Ellen wasn’t surprised. She knew the ways of well-to-do
white folks.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” she said patiently.</p>

<p>We sat down, and waited and waited. The first to
appear was the Boston bull. He came yawning out of
a bed-room, turned stiff-legged when he smelt me,
hipped four times round the swell reception room
where we were, then emboldened by my detached air,
came up, smelt his collar on my neck, bristled, and
closed with me.</p>

<p>As he had too much fat and too little wind, I easily
floored him, and such a gurgling&mdash;I thought he’d choke
to death with rage and fright.</p>

<p>A lovely stout lady in a pretty dressing-gown came
flying from one room, and a lean, hard-looking athlete
of a man from another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! my precious Beanie,” wailed the lady. Really,
the New York women do give their dogs sickening
names. This fellow, I learned, was Baked Beans, and
he had just about as much waist as a bean.</p>

<p>“Oh! you idiot,” growled the man.</p>

<p>Baked Beans was pretending I had nearly killed him.
I sized up my audience, then I walked up to the man,
crouched humbly before him, and put a protesting paw
on one of his bed-room slippers.</p>

<p>He must have stood six feet four in his pajamas. I
threw him one upward glance. He understood.</p>

<p>We dogs divide man and womankind into two
classes. Those who understand us, and those who
don’t.</p>

<p>He bent over me, slipped the silly collar from my
neck, and twisted it thoughtfully round and round in
his fingers. Then he began to laugh, and I thought he
would never stop.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” said the lady, who was hugging the
bull, “Rudolph, do stop. You get on my nerves. And
what do you see to laugh about? A nasty, fighting,
street dog bursts into our apartment, bullies poor
Beanie, and you admire him for it. I call it brute
force. Now, woman, tell me your business.”</p>

<p>Ellen was smiling indulgently. She was a Southern
negress, and had infinite indulgence for the whims of
fine ladies. She told her story in an honest, straightforward
manner, and the man believed her; but the
woman didn’t.</p>

<p>“How much do you want?” she asked coldly, when
Ellen had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“You needn’t give me anything, ma’am,” said Ellen
sweetly. “It’s a nice morning, and I’ve had a walk
before I goes to my work.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the gentleman turning to his wife,
“you will get cold, go back to bed, and I will arrange
this affair.”</p>

<p>“Come, Beanie darling,” said the lady, and she
tugged Beanie off in her arms, he looking over her
shoulder as if anxious to be in at the death.</p>

<p>The gentleman sat down and asked Ellen to repeat
her story. He cross-examined her, then he cross-examined
me, asking me questions exactly as if I were
a human being.</p>

<p>“This is the crux of the whole matter,” he remarked,
“How did that collar get off our dog’s neck to the
neck of this strange dog&mdash;who, by the way, is a thoroughbred.
Our maid said that there seemed to be no
man about, only a white dog running.”</p>

<p>The collar had fallen to the floor. I gambolled up
to it, ran my head through it, pawed it off, and went
back to the man.</p>

<p>“Come up here,” he said patting his knee, and I
sprang up, gave him one of my most intelligent glances,
and we were friends.</p>

<p>“You rogue,” he said, “you’re a dog of character,
and probably a Bohemian.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s American, sir,” said Ellen kindly.
“He knows all we say to him. I’ll take him, if you
don’t want him. I’d like a nice dog.”</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled, and said, “Let him choose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I’ll give him a week’s trial. Now, dog, is it go or
stay?”</p>

<p>It was stay, of course. I ran to Ellen, licked her
hands and even the face that she bent over me, but
I kept looking backward at my new owner.</p>

<p>“You must have something for your trouble,” he
murmured, and he went to his room for his purse,
and coming back, slipped a bill in her hand. It must
have been a big one, for she sneaked a glance at it,
then turned back as if to protest.</p>

<p>He waved her toward the door, then he glanced
toward his wife’s room, as if he were about to go
to it.</p>

<p>“Why anticipate trouble,” he muttered, and signing
to me to follow, he entered his own quarters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MY NEW MASTER</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">I jumped up on the window-seat and looked about
me. Some men have comforts, some don’t. This
man had a beautiful room overlooking the river, with
a nice, white bath-room off it. He splashed and
tumbled about in the water, then he dressed himself,
and all the while he examined me.</p>

<p>I licked a few stray hairs in place, and took some
mud off my paws with my tongue, to let him see I
was as clean in my ways as he was. I knew he would
not associate with me if I was a dirty dog.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said at last, “I like you; do you like me?”</p>

<p>I stood up straight, and put my two front paws as
far up on his chest as they would go. I loved him.
He was handsome, intellectual and unhappy.</p>

<p>Not that he looked unhappy. He had rather an
amused face, but we dogs see below the surface.</p>

<p>“Suppose you stay here till breakfast is over,” he
remarked. “No use in bringing on scenes. You’re
not hungry, are you?”</p>

<p>I shook my head, and curled up on the window seat.
He went away, and stayed a short time. I smelt coffee
and steak somewhere near, but I never budged, and
after a while he came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose you go down town with me, dog,” he said.
“The probability is that you would not spend a very
interesting morning with Madame and Beanie.”</p>

<p>He grinned and I grinned, then at last he walked
boldly out with me at his heels.</p>

<p>We met the lady in the hall, looking perfectly stunning
in some kind of a light coloured morning-gown.
Dogs don’t have much of an eye for colour. In fact,
most of us are colour blind.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” she screamed, “didn’t you turn that ugly
dog out?”</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder. “Oh! he’s still there,
is he? Likely he’ll leave me down town, and run home.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</i>, dearie. Don’t over-exert.”</p>

<p>She bent her cheek and he pecked at it, then he went
downstairs, and there at the door was such a jolly,
seven-seated motor car. Not a limousine, thank fortune.
I hate to drive in a glass box.</p>

<p>The man ran his own car, and I sat between him and
the chauffeur. Oh! what fun. We went flying down
Riverside Drive, till we couldn’t fly any longer, and we
had to turn into Seventy-Second Street and go soberly.
Finally we got away down town. So my new master
was a business man.</p>

<p>“What will you do?” he said when we at last pulled
up before a sky-scraper. “Go to the garage with
Louis, or come with me?”</p>

<p>As if there was any comparison between him and
Louis! I snuggled close to his smart-looking shoes
and silk socks, and together we went in and up, up to
a suite of offices where young men, elderly men, stenographers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and messengers hummed, and buzzed, and
worked, and talked till one o’clock.</p>

<p>I lay under the swivel chair in my new master’s
inner office, and enjoyed it all. I love to see human
beings working hard.</p>

<p>At one o’clock my master rose, and leaving this hive
of industry behind him, went out for lunch.</p>

<p>I have had training enough for ten dogs, and my
new master guessed it. He never looked behind, and
I never looked before. I kept my muzzle at his shoe
heels, and we passed leisurely through the swarms of
bees from other hives that were buzzing through halls
and in elevators. All were after honey, and we found
a particularly agreeable place for ours.</p>

<p>To my astonishment, when our turn came to enter
an elevator, we did not go down to the street, but
up to the top of the high building we were in. What
a surprise awaited me there. I knew there were restaurants
and roof gardens in New York, but I had
never been in one. I had been in a nice restaurant in
San Francisco at the top of a big building, and I was
there on the day of a slight earthquake when the
whole body of waiters, who wore mustaches, rushed
down to the street, shaved their mustaches off, and
went back to a famous club from which they had been
discharged because they would wear those same mustaches.</p>

<p>Well, something very fine awaited us at the top of
this New York building. We stepped out of the elevator,
went through a door, and there we were on
top of the enormous sky-scraper, and spread out before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
us was a view of wonderful New York, less wonderful
Brooklyn, the Jersey coast, and the magnificent
bay and islands.</p>

<p>Master had allowed me to jump on a chair so I
could look about me, for dogs, unless they stand high,
often lose a view that a human being can enjoy.</p>

<p>I was enchanted, but the wind blew so hard that I
was glad to jump down, and follow my new master
into a protected place. Here were tables, chairs, mirrors&mdash;a
regular, attractive and pretty restaurant, better
than any we would find on the street in this down
town district. It was enclosed by glass, and from
nearly all the seats, one could enjoy the same magnificent
view that one had outside.</p>

<p>My master did not stay in this eating-place, which
I learned afterward was for all the people in the building.
He passed through a long corridor, went down
some steps, along a covered walk&mdash;all this was glassed
in&mdash;and to the top of a lower building. Indeed, it
seemed to me that we were passing over the tops of
many buildings and I found out afterward that this
was correct. Mr. Granton&mdash;for this was my master’s
name&mdash;and some other men had acquired the right
to build on the tops of the sky-scrapers, and here they
had an agreeable promenade in fresh air, and away
from the dust of the street. At last we entered a
pretty little café, furnished in Louis something-or-other
style. Well, attached to this dainty little café with
its mirrors, and spindle-legged tables and chairs, was
a tiny, formal rose garden with real flowers and gravel
walks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole thing reminded me of Paris, and I soon
found out that it was a French restaurant, and that
my master, who had been partly educated in France,
loved the French people.</p>

<p>He had his lunch at a small table by himself, drawn
up close to the entrance of the garden, and I sat under
his chair, and inhaled the perfume of the roses, and
gazed at the pretty thing with ecstasy. It was enclosed
by lattice work entwined with green leaves, and
all round the lattice work ran a deep bed of flowering
roses. On looking closely, I found that they were in
pots sunk in trenches. However, the effect was of
a regular out-of-door flowering garden. In the middle
was a round bed with a pink rambler climbing round
a sun-dial. In one corner was a baby pergola with
another climber embracing it, and at the top of the
pergola a tiny little bird-box, out of which frequently
stepped a wee yellow canary. He had a box of seeds
fastened to the pergola, and when he wanted a drink,
he went to a tiny fountain in one corner of the garden.</p>

<p>While my master was eating, this little bird sang to
him, but did not offer to come near him. It was not
afraid of him, for Mr. Canary regarded the garden as
his home. Neither was he afraid of me, knowing he
had wings, and then, though he was only a mite of
a creature, he knew my attitude was not threatening.</p>

<p>He had a little mate among the roses, but she did
not come out&mdash;merely peeped at us.</p>

<p>Master had rather a dainty lunch for such a big
man. Mine was dainty too&mdash;a little too dainty for a
medium-sized dog&mdash;for Monsieur Canovel, who ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the café, had a Frenchman’s frugal ways. However,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</i> sneaked me a few extras. These foreigners
that come round, smirking and bowing, and hoping that
everything is to monsieur’s liking, are really not as
satisfactory as Americans, who apparently scarcely
glance at their patrons, yet if a prominent one brings
in a dog, say, “Waiter, give him a plateful.”</p>

<p>I love to run over the names of things to eat. Even
the sound is appetising, so I will say that master had
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</i> and vegetables served separately, and then
French stew, and a dish which smelt like those delicious
things made of hard crusts of bread, which poor children
pick out of the gutters in Paris and sell to the
restaurants, where they are washed and ground and
made into little pies.</p>

<p>Nobody saves crusts in this country. We Americans,
dogs and human beings, are too extravagant.
A French dog could live on the discards from my table.</p>

<p>After master had his lunch, he strolled about the
gravelled walks of the tiny garden that was not much
bigger than Gringo’s yard, for only twenty-five men
use this pretty place. He did not smoke, he whistled
to the canary, who knew him, and got angry when
master picked a rose from his pergola and put it in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>After a while, a gentleman who had been lunching
at a table near us came over to my master, and began
to talk about his arcade scheme, which I soon found
out was a plan to lessen the crowds on the streets
of New York, by building arcades like those on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Rue de Rivoli in Paris, except that the top would be
flat, so the people could walk on them too.</p>

<p>“It would give a double row of store-fronts,” said
my master’s friend, “and increase the value of second
story property. How much will you put in, Granton?”</p>

<p>Master said he would consider it.</p>

<p>“In addition,” went on his friend, “I have a plan to
force the owners of apartment-houses to build kennels
and runways on the tops of their houses, so that dogs
owned by tenants, can be exercised there, instead of in
the street, where they have to wear muzzles.”</p>

<p>Master smiled, and said, “That’s more in my line.
Let me know when you want to get that law passed,”
then he nodded good-bye to his friend, and we sauntered
back along the roofs to the elevator, and descended
to our hive.</p>

<p>He worked with the other bees till five, when we
swarmed to the street. There was Louis with the
car. I jumped up beside master, and we wended our
way uptown to Madame.</p>

<p>I gathered from Mr. Granton’s remarks that he
took her out nearly every day. On arriving before the
apartment-house, he murmured, “Suppose you get
under Louis’ lap-robe.” Then he added, “No&mdash;we
might as well have it out first as last.”</p>

<p>When Madame came out with Beanie toddling after
her, she stopped, and gave a squeal at sight of me.</p>

<p>“Rudolph, didn’t that ugly thing leave you?”</p>

<p>I bridled&mdash;I’m doggy in appearance, still I’m not
ugly&mdash;I’m distinguished. One of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons</i> at the
French restaurant said I looked like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chien de race</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and he was more right than he knew. “Clossie,” said
my master, “I like this dog.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” she said in her trailing voice.
“I know he’ll kill my darling boy.”</p>

<p>At sight of his wife, my master had jumped from the
car and stood on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Permit me,” he said, and leaning across her he
took young Fatty Beans and put him on the seat
beside me.</p>

<p>The lady gave a shriek, and covered her eyes with
her little white gloves.</p>

<p>When she looked up, young Beans sat beside me,
straight as a major. I had hissed in his ear, “If you
don’t pretend to like me, I’ll knock the stuffing out
of you, first chance I get.”</p>

<p>The young fellow didn’t want to get unstuffed, so
he turned to his mistress with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“Why, darling,” she said slowly, “I believe you like
him. Was he lonely doggie by his own seffies?”</p>

<p>He hadn’t been a lonely doggie by his own “seffies,”
but he was too frightened to tell her so, and if he had,
she didn’t possess enough knowledge of dogs to understand
him.</p>

<p>With a wondering face, Madame stepped in beside
her husband who had taken his old place.</p>

<p>“Now what about the dogs?” she asked. “I was
planning to take Beanie in here with me as usual, but
perhaps he’d rather sit with his new friend.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said her husband hastily. “Let
them both go with Louis.”</p>

<p>Louis was a splendidly trained servant. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Madame talked dog-talk he was convulsed with inward
laughter, but he showed no outward trace except
by a tremor of the eyelid. But when he got with other
chauffeurs&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma foi</i>! You’d die laughing to hear him
imitate her&mdash;but he liked Mrs. Granton all the time.
I found out that later.</p>

<p>After a time, we set out. Madame and Monsieur
in front, Louis and dogs behind.</p>

<p>Louis liked me, but he used to pinch Beans slyly.
Poor Beanie, he didn’t enjoy that first drive.</p>

<p>I was dying to know some friends of my new family.
Fortunately we met one who was walking down the
Drive with a collie dog at her heels. Oh! what a keen,
intelligent Scottish face he had, and hers was just as
keen and intelligent an American face.</p>

<p>My master stopped the car, and his wife called out,
“Why, how do you do, Stanna&mdash;want to have a spin
with us?”</p>

<p>Miss Stanna, all laughing and rosy in her black furs,
pointed to her dog. “Sir Walter Scott wouldn’t like
that. He’s out for his constitutional.”</p>

<p>“See our new dog?” continued Madame. “He’s absolutely
forced himself on us.”</p>

<p>Miss Stanna gave me a sharp glance. I gave her
one. She understood dogs too. I got up and stretched
my neck toward her.</p>

<p>“Later on, dog,” she said, and she waved her hand
toward me, “I’ll be charmed to have a talk with you.”
Then she called out, “Good-bye, Clossie and Rudolph;
good-bye, dogs,” and she strolled on.</p>

<p>We went on our way twisting and turning, but always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
gliding so smoothly about this wonderful city.
Is it because it is so big that one doesn’t get tired of
New York?</p>

<p>We had gone away out to Van Cortlandt Park, and
were thumping along a bit of bad road between the
sad trees with their scant covering of dry leaves, when,
to my dismay, we came suddenly abreast of another
car in which sat one of my former owners whom I
had not treated very well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">AN OLD FRIEND, AND AN ADVENTURE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Before I had time to dodge under the lap-robe,
Miss Bright-Eyes caught sight of me.</p>

<p>That was what I always called her, because she
had such piercing shoe buttons of eyes. Her real
name was Pursell, and she was a native daughter of
the Golden State. Her grandfather had been an old
forty-niner who had made a fortune in land.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Granton,” she giggled, “I think I see
an old friend with you. Where did you get him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton did not at first understand her, then
she said, “Oh! you mean the dog. Louis, make him
stand up, so Miss Pursell can see him. Do tell us
something about him.”</p>

<p>“See him wiggle and fawn,” said Miss Bright-Eyes.
“Oh! he is a rogue. I had him for a whole year, and
gave him the best time a dog ever had. We never
could make out why he ran away from us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Granton spoke up. “Do you mean to say you
had this dog out in California?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “in Los Angeles. We used to
have such fun. We’d motor to Santa Monica, and go
in bathing, and doggie had such good times. What
made you leave me, pup?” and she surveyed me good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>How I longed for the power of speech! She was
a fresh air and fresh water fiend. She used to take
me in bathing with her and make me dive under the
breakers, and she put cotton wool in her own ears but
never a spear in mine, and I got deaf; and then her
old man-servant used to bathe me in the garage and
get soap in my eyes with his wobbly old hands, and
I got angry, and cleared out. I am a clean dog, but
I don’t want the hide scoured off me.</p>

<p>Mr. Granton gave me one of his penetrating
glances, then he said to Miss Bright-Eyes, “Do you
think the dog was happy with you?”</p>

<p>“Happy, certainly,” she replied. “Everything was
done for him.”</p>

<p>I barked protestingly.</p>

<p>“Tell us how you treated him,” said Mr. Granton.</p>

<p>“Well, as soon as I had my breakfast, he was with
me till lunch time, walking or driving, then he spent
the rest of the day with the servants.”</p>

<p>“Interesting servants?” pursued Mr. Granton.</p>

<p>“Well, not particularly. All old ones&mdash;they belonged
to my grandmother.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” murmured Mr. Granton thoughtfully, “and
he would be younger then than he is now, and he’s
lively yet. Where did you get him?”</p>

<p>“Bought him from a man in the street,” said Miss
Pursell. “He said he found him running about without
a collar. He has lots of tricks. Jump out, dog,
and let me put you through some of your stunts.”</p>

<p>I was quite stiff from sitting so long, but I wanted
to please Mr. Granton, so I sprang out to a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
level ground and danced on my hind legs, rolled over,
did dead dog, howled an operatic air with one paw on
my chest, and wound up with double somersaults.</p>

<p>The Grantons laughed heartily, but Beanie was
nearly suffocated with jealousy, and when I got back
beside him and Louis, he bit me.</p>

<p>What a nip he got in return! Mrs. Granton
screamed at his loud howl, and turning round, reproached
Louis for not taking better care of him.</p>

<p>Louis pressed his gloved hand to his mouth and
said in a choked voice, “Beg pardon, ma’am. I accidentally
squeezed his ear with my arm.” Then he
gave me a poke with his elbow and said, “No more of
that, you young Spitfire.”</p>

<p>We went spinning toward Yonkers after we left
Miss Pursell, and just after getting beyond it, had
an adventure.</p>

<p>We were on a fine piece of road&mdash;what magnificent
roads they are building, and so quickly too, outside
most American cities&mdash;when we came to a big, powerfully
ugly, red brick house, standing in its own grounds.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mrs. Granton, “Suppose we call
on the Johnsons. It’s just about afternoon tea time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Granton didn’t want to, but she made him do
it. We rolled up to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>, but master was
going to have his own way in something, and when
she wanted to take Beanie in, he wouldn’t let her.</p>

<p>So Louis and I and Beanie were instructed to take
a little spin down the road, and come back in twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>Just after we left the red brick house, we came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a long, level bit of road, and Louis was speeding up
a bit when I pulled his sleeve. Off on our right was
a sheet of water, with a man in it, yelling his head off
for help.</p>

<p>Louis was out of the machine like a shot, and I after
him. Beanie sat blinking. I can see him now, the
silly ass.</p>

<p>The little French chauffeur danced about at the edge
of the water, like a monkey on hot bricks. Before I
came to New York, there had been quite a time of
sharp weather, and ice had formed. This foolish fellow
in the water had taken his skates and gone off to
have a little fun by himself. Now he was splashing
about, postponing his final going under as long as
possible.</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on,” called Louis; “I’m coming,”
but instead of coming, he went smashing through the
thin ice just as often as he stepped on it.</p>

<p>I learned afterward, that he was a fine swimmer,
and quite an athlete, but what could he do when he
couldn’t get to the man?</p>

<p>He had thrown his cap and coat on the ground, and
seizing his hair by both hands, he whirled round and
round in the road, in his uncertainty. Not a soul was
in sight. Fortunately his desperate eyes fell on the
extra tire at the back of the car.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, he had it off, and lashed to it a rope
that Mr. Granton always has him carry in the car.
The marvellous thing was, that he hadn’t thought of
the rope at first. Master would have, if he’d been
there. Well, it wasn’t too late now, and didn’t he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hurl that tire at the poor drowning man who had just
enough strength left to cling to it. Then Louis, playing
the man as one would a salmon, tried to haul
him in.</p>

<p>He is as slight as a girl, and couldn’t do it. He
tugged and panted, and groaned, and called out, but no
one came, and I suppose we had passed thousands of
cars that afternoon.</p>

<p>Finally, Louis had another bright idea. He tied the
rope to the car, sprang to his seat, and off he started,
looking frequently over his shoulder.</p>

<p>He easily motored the man to land, then springing
from the car, took hold of him to support his half-fainting
body to the car.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary to report what he said when he
found the man was an enormously fat lady with bloomers
on. However, with some help from her, he tugged
her into the car and laid her on the floor of it, under
the surprised Beanie who sat on the seat looking as
if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>Then didn’t we fly to the brick house. I ran after
the car, and hadn’t a bit of breath left when we got
there.</p>

<p>The people came running out, and lifted the fat lady
in, who, it seems, was a very important person&mdash;an
English suffragette who had come to this country because
she wouldn’t stop throwing bricks at shop windows
in England. She was a guest in the house and
her name was Lady Serena Glandison. She was also
to give a lecture that night in New York. I heard the
Grantons talking about it afterward, and master said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
she was a dead-game sport, for she persisted in giving
the lecture.</p>

<p>She wanted to reduce her flesh, and had gone off
to have a quiet little skate by herself, not being particularly
beautiful in bloomers. Wasn’t she grateful
to Louis! She said most undoubtedly she would have
drowned, but for him. She sent him a cheque for a
thousand dollars, and he is to get more later on, when
women get the vote in England and she doesn’t have
to spend so much in fines for her pastime of window
smashing.</p>

<p>“If they ever do,” said my master.</p>

<p>I may add that Lady Serena is an ultra who wouldn’t
stop her militant work on account of the war. She
says she can see lots of reasons for smashing windows,
but none for smashing men’s ribs. So she came to
America to wait for the fighting to be over in Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">BEANIE LOSES HIS HOME</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">A week or two went by, and I was as happy as
a king&mdash;maybe I’d better say a president, as
kings don’t seem to be getting much fun out of life
at present.</p>

<p>I had had many homes, many masters and mistresses,
but never a master like this one. He just suited me.
I often used to wonder what it was about him that
made me like him so much. I had seen men just as
handsome, just as amiable, just as lovable&mdash;there was
something I could not explain about it. When he
looked at me with his deep-set grey eyes, I felt that
I could die for him. He was my man affinity. He
understood me, and he never believed anything against
me unless it was very fully proved, and then&mdash;he always
forgave me.</p>

<p>His confidence in me made me want to be a better
dog, and I stopped nipping Beanie on the sly, and gave
up stealing Mrs. Granton’s gloves and chewing them
up.</p>

<p>I didn’t like her, and she didn’t like me. What
could you make of a woman who insisted upon being
called “Clossie” instead of Claudia, which was her real
name. Claudia has some dignity to it, but Clossie&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
didn’t sound to me like a lady, and master just hated
it, but he had to say it.</p>

<p>They didn’t get on very well together. I often heard
the servants talking about it. Louis was for mistress,
and the cook and the waitress and the girl who came
to do mistress’s hair and finger-nails were for master.</p>

<p>“She’s a fraud,” said cook emphatically. “A
woman her age ain’t got no business lazing in bed till
all hours of the morning, and when she gets up, what
does she do? Fools round, putting in time, and then
travels down town and wastes money shopping, or
goes to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“She don’t do nothing for nobody all day long,” the
waitress would break in. “It’s self, self, self&mdash;do I
look pretty&mdash;is my skin all right&mdash;am I getting old&mdash;bah!
I’d like to give her a job scouring brasses.”</p>

<p>Then Louis would stand up for her. “The old
man’s clever (I regret to say they usually called master
the old man, and mistress Mrs. Putty-Face). Why
don’t he make more of her? If she was my wife,
I’d teach her things. Why don’t he point out things
on the river when we’re motoring, and do he ever
read to her of an evening?”</p>

<p>He never did, but the maids wouldn’t tell him this,
so Louis, who was a French-American, speaking fairly
good English with here and there a funny mistake,
went on. “When I comes in for orders, there he sits
glooming one side of the fire, she the other&mdash;the table
a-tween them. Man and wife should be close up, and
speaking by-times.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“She ain’t got no language,” said cook. “She never
does talk but of fooleries.”</p>

<p>“She stands for her dog,” said Louis feebly, for
the women always out-talked him.</p>

<p>Here the young girl who did her hair and nails, and
who used to come out to the kitchen for a cup of tea,
made a very dismal prophecy about Beanie that unfortunately
came true.</p>

<p>“Just listen to me,” she said wrinkling her dark eyebrows,
“that woman ain’t got no thought for anything
but herself. Husband, help, dog&mdash;she’d see you all
in the Hudson, and never lift a finger to save you.
Why, when that fat dog comes between her and a
table or a chair in the bed-room, that she’s making
for, he gets a push that lands him most into the next
room. If she took it into her head to get rid of him,
out he’d go.”</p>

<p>Louis was sweet on this girl, and he smiled at her.
“I never saw no kicking from her,” he remarked
amiably. “Mrs. Putty-Face has been kind along to me.
I often gets a tip. Maybe she’ll make good yet. She’s
young, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>This brought on a long, tiresome argument. When
the maids got on mistress’s clothes or her age, I always
left the kitchen. Why don’t they talk about the war
or politics, instead of that eternal drivel about master
and mistress?</p>

<p>The two people at the head of the establishment
never mentioned them, nor looked at them, except to
ask for something. I wonder whether that was not
one reason why there was not more sympathy between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the working end and the commanding end of the house.
I had been in several homes before this, where there
was criticism between employer and employed, but a
criticism softened by sympathy and mutual interest.</p>

<p>I blamed mistress. Down at the café, the servants
were never familiar with the gentlemen patrons, but
there was a good spirit prevailing, and I heard no
hateful remarks there. The gentlemen were kind to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons</i>, in a quiet way, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons</i> were respectful
to the gentlemen, and they got their reward,
for once when one of them fell ill, the gentlemen
clubbed together, and sent him to a beautiful place in
the country.</p>

<p>To come back to Beanie, I had noticed for several
days that mistress hadn’t been talking silly talk to him,
and usually left him home, when she went out in the
car. He wasn’t apprehensive about it. His too solid
flesh made him a stupid dog. He was simply annoyed
to miss his outing. However, to give him credit, he
never said a word against his mistress. He just plodded
round the apartment after her, never doubting
that she adored him as much as she said she did.</p>

<p>One evening, when she was sitting with her two
pretty, light slippers stretched out toward the wood
fire in the fire-place, she said suddenly, “Rudolph, I’m
going to change Beanie and get a toy Pomeranian.”</p>

<p>Mr. Granton turned round and said, “What!” He
was sitting, as he usually did, beside a little table
which had a shaded electric light on it. He was reading
a book about the war, and sometimes stopped to
gaze thoughtfully in the fire. Mrs. Granton wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
talk about it to him. All she knew about the fighting
in Europe was, that it would stop, for a time, her
yearly visits to Paris to buy gowns.</p>

<p>He was staring at her. Finally he said, “I thought
you were fond of Beanie.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was,” she said carelessly, “but Poms
are more fashionable, and smaller. Beanie’s too fat
to carry, and I think a small dog under the arm looks
smart.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with Beanie?” asked Mr. Granton.</p>

<p>“Sell him of course&mdash;I’ll get a good price. I gave
two hundred for him. I’ll send him to a vet to be
starved for a while. He’s too fat now.”</p>

<p>Upon my word, I was sorry for Beanie. He sat
listening to her, as if he could scarcely believe his
ears. The poor simpleton had so presumed on the fact
of her loving him. I could have told him long ago, he
was in a dog-fool paradise.</p>

<p>Mr. Granton opened his mouth, as if to say something,
then he shut it again. He took up his book,
and went on reading about the war till Mrs. Granton’s
smacking of her lips over her chocolates and novel
got on his nerves. It usually did about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>He got up, looked out the window, said, “I think I’ll
take a walk.” Then he said carelessly, “Have you
quite made up your mind to sell your dog?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” she said, smiling and showing her pretty
teeth. She was really very pinky sweet and lovely.
If she had only had a mind in her doll body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you would be satisfied with two hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“I’d be satisfied with a hundred and fifty,” she said,
“he’s no longer quite young, according to looks. His
amount of flesh ages him.”</p>

<p>Beanie gasped and panted by the fire, and finally
went to hide his shamed head in the corner.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know he understands all this,” said
Mr. Granton.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” she said, “he’s only a dog.”</p>

<p>This roused poor young Beans. He waddled up to
her, rose on his hind legs, and laid his two forepaws
on her lap. His mouth was wide open, and he was
panting heavily, trying to look engaging and fascinating,
and succeeding only in looking silly.</p>

<p>“Go away, you little fool,” she said pushing him
aside. “I’ve taken a dislike to you.”</p>

<p>Beanie went to hide his diminished head under the
sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. Granton was drawing a fountain pen from his
pocket, and a little book. He wrote out a cheque for
one hundred and fifty dollars, and gave it to her.</p>

<p>“You might have made it two hundred,” she said
peevishly.</p>

<p>He smiled. He was too good a man of business to
pay more for a thing than he had to, even to his own
wife.</p>

<p>“Your dog is mine now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she replied carelessly, “and mind, I
don’t want that fat awkward thing round this apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
We’ve too many dogs now,” and she glared
at me.</p>

<p>She had never forgiven me for staying with her
husband, and I knew, and he knew, that she was jealous
of me.</p>

<p>“I’ll find a home for him,” said Mr. Granton.
“Come on, Beans, since you’re my dog now, come out
and take a walk with Boy and me.”</p>

<p>He always called me Boy or Boy-Dog. He said
I was too clever to be just plain dog.</p>

<p>I hate sorrow and suffering and ugly things. With
my tail between my legs, I slunk after my master. I
didn’t like to look at Beanie. He was behind me.
Poor, poor young dog&mdash;prematurely aged on account
of the over feeding, over-petting and the over-everything
of a foolish mistress, and now shaken out of his paradise.</p>

<p>He looked frightfully, but he made an effort to
hold himself up, and waddled toward the elevator
with us.</p>

<p>When we got in the street, Mr. Granton said kindly,
“I’ll carry you a while, old man. You’re rather
knocked in a heap,” and he actually took that fat
young dog under his arm, and walked block after
block with him, till Beanie got back some of his usual
complacent self-possession.</p>

<p>Then he put him down, and walked slower than
usual, in order to accommodate his new acquisition.
I walked close to Beanie, and from time to time touched
his head with my muzzle.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, young fellow,” I said, “you’re lucky to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
have changed hands. You would have been dead in
a few months. You’re all out of condition. Master
will get you a good home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want another home,” he said miserably.
“I want my old one, and I love my mistress.”</p>

<p>“In spite of the way she’s treated you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference with a dog,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“It would with me,” I said.</p>

<p>“You’re not an ordinary dog,” he said. “You’re
an exception.”</p>

<p>“I believe that’s true,” I said. “I wonder where
we’re going.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, and I don’t care,” he said wretchedly,
and he plodded along like a machine.</p>

<p>Master had left Riverside Drive, and was going
slowly up One Hundred and Thirty-ninth Street. Soon
we were in the shadow of Great Hall of the College
of New York. Some one was playing the organ, and
through an open door, we could catch the solemn strains
of some dirge-like music.</p>

<p>Master stood still for a while, either to listen, or
to breathe the panting Beanie, whose eyes were dim
with tears, as he looked not up at the white-picked
stone mass of the building, but down at the cold, stone
pavement.</p>

<p>Presently we went on with our faces to the east.
Now it dawned upon me where we were going. I
jumped and frisked about my master. How clever
he was. He had remembered old Ellen’s address. She
was just the one to soothe and comfort poor Beanie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“See what a nice wide avenue you’re going to live
on,” I said to Beanie.</p>

<p>“There’s no view of the River,” he muttered.</p>

<p>I sighed. There’s no comforting a dog with a
broken heart.</p>

<p>He did cheer up a bit, when we got into Ellen’s flat.
How glad she was to see my master. Not cringingly
glad, but glad in the nice, affectionate way coloured
people have toward those they like.</p>

<p>She was sitting in one of the big rocking-chairs in
her tiny kitchen, and had evidently been looking out
the window at the crowds of people sauntering to and
fro on the brightly lighted avenue. This was a great
place for the coloured persons employed among whites
to come to see their friends and families, and on a
fine evening they did a good deal of their talking in
the street.</p>

<p>Master motioned her back to her chair, and he took
Robert Lee’s rocker at the other little window.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a present,” he said, and he
glanced at Beanie and me as we lay at his feet.</p>

<p>Old Ellen’s face glowed. “A present&mdash;for me, sir?
May the Lord bless you.”</p>

<p>“It’s alive,” said my master, and he pointed to
Beanie.</p>

<p>Ellen almost screamed. “Sir! not that lovely, fat
dog!”</p>

<p>Master nodded, and she swooped down on Beanie,
and took him, troubles and all, right up in her ample
lap. It reminded me of the song she sang me when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was here before. “Take up de young lambs, tote ’em
in your bosom, an’ let de ole sheep go.”</p>

<p>Beanie’s whole soul was shrinking from her, but he
put a steady face on his troubles, and even curled his
short lip gratefully at her.</p>

<p>She began to sway to and fro, rubbing her bleached
old hand over his tired head.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him out alone,” said my master, “he
might run home.”</p>

<p>Ellen’s face was almost silly with happiness. “There
ain’t no little pickaninny in New York, that’ll have
the ’tention this little master dog will have,” she said
earnestly.</p>

<p>She always began to talk in a southern way when
she saw master. I think he recalled her old employers
down South.</p>

<p>“How will you feed him?” asked my master. “He
has quite a good appetite.”</p>

<p>Ellen looked master all over with the good-natured
cunning of her race. “Sir,” she said, “you looks like
the gen’l’men down South&mdash;you wouldn’t let your little
dog suffer nohow, even if it was Ellen’s.”</p>

<p>Master laughed heartily. He loved frankness, and
hated deceit. “Ellen,” he said, “that dog will have a
limited income as long as he lives. It will be paid
weekly, and you will have to go to an address I will
give you to get it. As he enjoys driving, I will have
a carriage call for you once a week, and you can take
Beans with you to report for himself.”</p>

<p>Old Ellen didn’t know what to say. She looked
everywhere&mdash;all round the room, out the window,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
down at the dog in her lap, and hard at me, as I sat
staring at her.</p>

<p>Finally she got up, put Beanie down, and said quietly,
“Sir, would you like a cup of coffee?”</p>

<p>“Very much,” he replied.</p>

<p>Ellen lighted her gas stove, got out the big pot,
made the coffee, and handed him a cup and saucer that
she took from a cupboard in the wall.</p>

<p>Master handled it in surprise. “This is Sèvres,”
he said, “and costly.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said solemnly, “that was a present from
my old mistress whose heart was broke by de war.”</p>

<p>Master held the cup out from him, as if he dreaded
to touch his lips to it.</p>

<p>“But,” said old Ellen in the queer, mysterious voice
negroes can assume, “happiness come afore she died&mdash;Sir,
is you happy?”</p>

<p>The big, old negress suddenly towered over my
master, and laid a hand on his head.</p>

<p>“No, Ellen,” he said quite simply, “God knows I’m
not happy.”</p>

<p>The old woman stared up at the ceiling, and her
eyes became quite glassy. “Oh! Lord,” she said with
a frightful fervour&mdash;“drive away de clouds from poor
Mister’s heart. Bring him light&mdash;It’s comin’. Oh!
Lord&mdash;I see it&mdash;comin’ like de wings of an eagle. I
see it a-swoopin’ right down on Mister, dear, good
man,” and suddenly turning her back on him, she began
to clap her hands.</p>

<p>Master drank his coffee, and never said a word. I
had been with him long enough to know, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a very unemotional man, and yet he was all alive with
tenderness inside.</p>

<p>He had a little superstition too, for he was watching
Ellen from the corner of his eye, and was pleased
by her interest in him.</p>

<p>Finally he got up, and went over to poor young
Beans who lay in the chair, taking no stock in all this
sentiment.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dog,” he said. “You’re young&mdash;you’ll
get over this.”</p>

<p>Beans, of course, tried to follow us from the room.
Our last sight of him, was at the head of the staircase,
struggling in old Ellen’s arms.</p>

<p>“Dog, dog,” she said rebukingly, “old Ellen
knows. There’s a cloud going to burst over you all.
Mister an’ dog&mdash;an’ it’s full o’ blessings.”</p>

<p>My master smiled at intervals all the way home.
He always made for Riverside Drive, and never stayed
any longer than he could help in the blocks and blocks
of streets between it and East River. This night there
were heavy masses of clouds over the river, but just
before we got home, the moon broke through, and
showed a superb, smiling face.</p>

<p>My master paused, and leaning both elbows on the
stone parapet, stared at the moon. “Suppose it should
come,” he murmured&mdash;“perfect happiness&mdash;in the
right way&mdash;the only way it could come now, is a wrong
way.”</p>

<p>His voice was frightfully sad and perplexed. How
I longed to comfort him, but I was only a dog&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
moreover, I didn’t know all his troubles. I was pretty
sure they weren’t money troubles.</p>

<p>I did all I could. I jumped up, and licked his hand.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said, withdrawing his gaze from the moon
to look at me, “you’re the greatest comfort I have.”</p>

<p>Wasn’t I proud and happy! I almost wriggled myself
out of my body.</p>

<p>With a beautiful smile, but a heavy sigh, he turned,
and we started toward home which we did not reach
without a further adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE WOMAN BY THE RIVER</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">As all travelled dogs know, Riverside Drive,
which I claim is the loveliest stretch of avenue
in New York, has, at intervals, a sunburst of a park.
Those strips of park are delicious for my race. Did
you ever notice a sober, city dog trotting behind his
master till an open square is reached? If he is a normal
dog, his legs begin to dance, and he begs permission
to have a scamper.</p>

<p>Some of these little fool-dog creations that have
been inbred till they are nothing but a stomach with a
little skin wrapped round it, have, of course, no natural
impulse left, but I insist that any dog with a remnant
of real dog left in him, adores the open. We get this
love of liberty from our wolf and dingo ancestors.</p>

<p>Well, as I trotted behind and before, and encircled
and interwove master, better than any skirt dancer
could have done, I heard presently a wailing in front
of us.</p>

<p>We soon came up with the wailer&mdash;a dirty, pretty
child about four years of age, dragged by the arm by
a sullen, slatternly woman who looked about as much
out of place on Riverside Drive as master would have
looked in Gringo’s saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman was tired and ugly, and the child was
discouraged and weary. Poor little imp&mdash;I can see
his bare legs now, looking cold and fiery in the nipping
night air.</p>

<p>Master followed behind the woman, biting his lip,
and trying to hold himself back, but he couldn’t.</p>

<p>At last, when a jerk more forcible than any before
made the little wanderer burst into heartsore weeping,
something gave way in master, and he strode after the
woman.</p>

<p>He held his hat in his hand, and I could see the perspiration
glistening on his forehead.</p>

<p>The child turned his poor, little, tear-stained face
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Master held out both his hands, “Oh! give him to
me!” he said in a dreadful voice.</p>

<p>Now I knew one reason at least, why he was not
happy. He wanted a little child of his own.</p>

<p>The awful looking woman turned, and confronted
him like an angry, hissing snake.</p>

<p>“Not much,” she just spat at him, and taking the
child in her arms, she kissed it and comforted it, and
went on her weary way.</p>

<p>“Would you kidnap all I’ve got left?” she said savagely
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Master’s hands dropped to his sides. His face
looked like the moon when it burst through the clouds.</p>

<p>“So you love it,” he said in a delicious voice.</p>

<p>“Love it,” she croaked, then she said some emphatic
words that didn’t hurt me nor my master, and which
are not necessary to repeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m drug out,” she said, after we’d followed her
for a few steps.</p>

<p>“Stop,” said my master, and he took the child from
her and swung it up to the stone wall, and stood staring
into his little face, so happy now because his mother
had comforted him.</p>

<p>“What are you doing up here?” he asked the woman,
without looking at her.</p>

<p>She sank down on the ground, just like a dog.</p>

<p>“I came up to see a janitor in one of those big
houses,” she said, “he used to be a pal of mine, but he’s
moved. If he’d been there, I’d got a car fare and some
grub.”</p>

<p>Master didn’t ask her story. It was written all over
her. “Would you work in a laundry?” he asked presently.</p>

<p>“Who’d take me?” she said sneeringly. “Look at
that, for dirt,” and she held up a bit of her horrible
dress.</p>

<p>“My laundry would,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>“You ain’t got a laundry,” she said quickly, and
she shot a glance up at him from her bleared eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes I have&mdash;here’s the address,” and he thrust a
card in her hand.</p>

<p>“Read it,” she said drearily. “I ain’t got my specks.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven,” muttered my master, casting her
a reluctant glance. “Not much over twenty, and senile
decay.”</p>

<p>As if understanding him, she murmured, “You had
good feed when you was a kid. I was stuffed from
swill cans, and treated to tasty bits from the dumps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>A shudder ran over my master. “Don’t you write
no country name,” she said with feeble wrath. “I’ll
not leave this little old New York agin.”</p>

<p>“It’s ’way down town,” he said shortly, as he handed
her the card, “and here’s car fare. Mind, no drink
on the way.”</p>

<p>“I’m too beat out,” she said, struggling to her feet.
“I’ve heard of you. You’re the odd fellow that runs
that place for the likes of us, an’ ain’t too partickler
about rules. I’ll go in, for I’ve wanted to get in, but
didn’t know how, and I’ll stay till I die, and go to nobody
knows where. That’ll be soon, an’ you kin have
him”&mdash;and she nodded toward the child.</p>

<p>Master turned to leave her. “Stop,” she said in
her husky voice, “I’m goin’ to wish somethin’ on you.”
Then she looked up at the moon. “He ain’t got a kid
of his own,” she said softly, “I know by the look in
his eyes. Send him one, Mrs. Moon, you’re the only
mother I know.”</p>

<p>As if afraid he would thank her, she held her child
tight to her, and shuffled off toward Broadway.</p>

<p>Master stared after her for a long time, then he
muttered, “That’s the second time I’ve been blessed
to-night. Queer, isn’t it, dog?&mdash;Now, as that child
must have a warm welcome at the laundry, let’s go telephone
before we get home. We don’t want our right
hand to know too much about the left hand.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">STANNA AND NAPOLEON</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Some very interesting things happened right
straight along after that night. I found out lots
of things about my master. He was a regular public
benefactor and he had the name of being one of the
stingiest men on the Drive.</p>

<p>He did everything anonymously. Rich people are
horribly preyed upon in New York. Some of his
friends who were known to be generous used to get
a mail that staggered the postman. They were stung
and bothered by their benefactions as if they had been
noxious insects.</p>

<p>Master’s beneficiaries couldn’t sting him, for they
didn’t know who he was. He found many of them
on the Drive, and at night. For such a quiet man, it
was wonderful to see him make friends.</p>

<p>He would saunter along the Drive, stop to lean on
the stone walls or bridge railings, or sit on one of the
seats, and some other man would be pretty sure to
engage him in conversation. It’s mostly always the
sad who loiter. The happy walk quickly. Master always
wore an old coat, and a cap pulled pretty well
over his face. Many a man did he save from despair,
either by a word of comfort, or by some assistance in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
business. He had no home for men, but he had had
his Bluebird Laundry for women, for some time.</p>

<p>All his reports from it he received at night. The
director would join him on the Drive, usually at midnight,
and they would walk to and fro and talk of
more things they could do for the benefit of girls and
women who were out of employment, and who hated
restraint.</p>

<p>Master never visited the place, for he didn’t want to
be recognised. He was astonishingly keen, however,
in knowing all about it. One night, I heard him ask
the director if a certain room didn’t want repapering.</p>

<p>The man looked at him in surprise. “It does, but
how do you know?”</p>

<p>Master’s face glowed. “I see it all in my mind’s
eye.” Then he added, “Refurnish the room too, and
have the bluebirds larger than ever. Women need
more and more happiness.”</p>

<p>One evening, as we were setting out earlier than
usual, we walked down by the collie dog’s house, and
met Miss Stanna coming out to exercise him.</p>

<p>I had got to love this young girl who often visited
the Grantons. She was not so very young&mdash;twenty-two
or thereabout. She had a brave, fine face, and it never
grew weary, no matter how worried she was inside.</p>

<p>By things the servants said, I knew that Stanna and
her brother lived with a grandmother, that they had
been very rich, but the war had made them poor, and
the grandmother was trying to find a rich husband for
Stanna, and the girl wouldn’t help her.</p>

<p>“Hello! Wasp,” said my master, quite like a jolly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
young boy. His face always lighted up when he saw
this pretty girl, and in common with all the persons in
her set, he called her by her nickname.</p>

<p>I asked Walter Scott one day why his young mistress
was called the Wasp, and he said it was on account
of a costume she wore at a fancy ball, a short
time ago. The dress was black and gold and had gauzy
wings, and ever since that time her intimate friends had
called her “Wasp” or “Waspie.”</p>

<p>Miss Stanna had very pretty manners, for much
pains had been taken with her education. Naturally,
she was very frank and mischievous, but she was always
covering up this native gush and frolicsomeness
by an assumed conventionality.</p>

<p>To-night she looked merry, and full of fun. She
bowed very prettily, and gave a little skip as she held
out her hand to my master.</p>

<p>“Grandmother is terribly shocked,” she said laughing
all over her face, “but Walter Scott was pining for
a run, and the maids are out, and brother Carty too.
I promised to stay fifteen minutes only, and to walk
up and down in sight of the house. I’m so glad you’ve
come&mdash;scamper now, Sir Walter and Boy Dog.”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to scamper, I wanted to hear her talk,
for I was very much interested in her. So I kept close
to my master, and Sir Walter, after finding out that I
did not care to accompany him, ran off alone. That
dog always had such perfect manners&mdash;acquired
abroad, for he had been born in a castle in Scotland,
and rather looked down on everybody on the Drive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
human beings and dogs too, because so few of us were
perfectly aristocratic.</p>

<p>He claimed that it was impossible to acquire finish
of manner and conventional elegance in a country as
new as America. We used to have heated arguments
about it, and his known opinions on the subject kept
him from becoming a favourite among the dogs in our
set.</p>

<p>He said I was an aristocro-democrat dog, while he
was pure aristocrat. I said I was a good, American
dog, and believed in our own institutions, George Washington
and all that sort of thing; and I claimed that
if one worked hard enough at it, one could obtain ease
of manner and polish in this country as well as in any
other.</p>

<p>Walter was never convinced. I used to say to him,
“Don’t you call your own owner a perfect lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he would say uneasily, “yet her manners in
repose, haven’t the perfect repose that characterises
the pose of women abroad.”</p>

<p>By abroad he meant “Europe,” which he never
would say. Europe was “the continent” to him. England,
Scotland and Ireland were “home.”</p>

<p>“But you never were in Ireland,” I used to say to
him, “how can you call it ‘home’?”</p>

<p>“It is in the old country,” he would reply seriously.</p>

<p>To come back to the ladies. Walter or Sir Walter,
as he preferred being called, liked a dull, dead stillness
of manner&mdash;a kind of “I’ve-just-been-to-a-funeral,”
or “I’m-just-going-to-one,” air.</p>

<p>Now I like liveliness in women. I’ve been abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and though I admire Englishwomen and Scotchwomen,
you can’t have as much fun with them, nor can you tell
what they’re thinking about as quickly as you can
read an American or a Frenchwoman. However,
every dog to his liking. Give me gaiety and fun&mdash;Sir
Walter can keep his goddesses and statues.</p>

<p>Miss Stanna just suited me to-night. Her eyes were
dancing, and her little black pumps could scarcely keep
on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” asked my master
uneasily.</p>

<p>He was one of the executors of her father’s estate,
and took a business, as well as a friendly interest in
the family.</p>

<p>She didn’t say “Nothing,” as most girls would have.
She said, “Everything.”</p>

<p>Master gave her a queer, sidelong look and said,
“I heard my wife remark to-day, that it is a long time
since you have been to see her.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been busy,” said Stanna with a ripple of a
laugh.</p>

<p>She had stopped, and was staring hard at a big,
old-fashioned mansion standing on one corner of the
street we were passing. It was gloomier than ever to-night
in the electric lights. Even by daylight it looked
forbidding, except in front where it faced the Drive,
for it was surrounded by a semi-circle of huge apartment
houses.</p>

<p>“Who has bought that old Sweeney house?” asked
my Master, as he followed her glance. “I see workmen
there every day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“A queer man,” she said with an odd little smile,
“a saloon-keeper from the Bowery.”</p>

<p>Didn’t I prick up my ears! Something told me
that was Gringo’s master. You know dogs are very
quick at understanding. I can’t explain why it is, but
something inside me tells me when to jump to a conclusion,
and I jump, and nearly always land on my
feet.</p>

<p>“The Bowery,” said my master wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You never saw such an odd man,” she went on in
a musing way, and with her eyes fixed on the dark
house standing so solemnly among its lighted neighbours.
“He’s not like any one I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t that fellow who is being lionised because
he made the fortune out of the soft drink places, is
he?” asked my master.</p>

<p>“The same&mdash;did you ever see him?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t had that pleasure,” said my master dryly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. van der Spyten took him up, and Grandmother
followed suit. He’s handsome in a cold, quiet
way and, wonderful to relate&mdash;the dead image of Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon and the Bowery!” said my master disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Grandmother can make him talk more than any
one,” continued Miss Stanna. “She’s unearthed the
fact that his father belonged to a good, old English
family, that he married a barmaid and ran away to
America, that he lived in Chicago, and had this son
who seems to have lived everywhere from Chicago to
Rio Janeiro.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is he a gentleman?” asked my master.</p>

<p>The girl turned on him quickly. “Now what do you
mean by a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“You know,” he said doggedly.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t then. He knows how to read and
write, and make money, but a drawing-room throws
him into a bored agony, and a dinner table is an extended
nightmare to his unaccustomed spirit.”</p>

<p>Master shook his head, and frowned terribly.</p>

<p>“But fancy the sensation, Rudolph,” continued Miss
Stanna, “of meeting some one to whom our tiresome
conventionalities are blank and unwished-for novelties.
I sat beside him the other night at dinner. Something
told me he didn’t know what to do with his forks and
spoons.”</p>

<p>“‘I dare you to eat with your knife,’ I whispered.”</p>

<p>“And did he?” asked my master breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Every morsel. Oh! the sensation. How was
Grandmother going to cover that up? She had excuses
for everything. ‘Ah! the poor fellow,’ she said,
‘deprived of his father at an early age, cast on the
cold world, obliged to eat when and where he could,
then his noble qualities asserting themselves, and bringing
him back to the sphere in which he was born,
where he is amply prepared to shine as one of the
leading philanthropists of the day.’”</p>

<p>“So&mdash;that’s his pose, is it?” asked my master.</p>

<p>“His pose,” said the girl bursting into a laugh, “his
pose&mdash;my dear Rudolph&mdash;he affirms over and over
again, ‘I didn’t sell temperance drinks to reform men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I did it to make money,’ and no one believes him.
He’s a hero despite himself.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re going to marry him,” said my
master irritably.</p>

<p>“That’s what Grandmother says,” remarked Miss
Stanna with an angelic smile.</p>

<p>“I shall look into this,” said my master firmly. “We
are your oldest friends. Your Grandmother and Carty
are coercing you, I believe.”</p>

<p>Stanna didn’t speak. “There he is,” she said softly.</p>

<p>We all looked across the street and there&mdash;I was
going to say plodding, but that is too heavy a word&mdash;walking
steadfastly along the pavement, was a man
of medium-height, with a sour-looking bull-dog at his
heels.</p>

<p>“Gringo, by all that’s wonderful,” I muttered.</p>

<p>“We didn’t know he was going to call this evening,”
murmured Stanna. “Grandmother will be distracted.
She will have to go to the door.”</p>

<p>“You would better go home,” said my master dryly.</p>

<p>“No hurry,” said the girl mischievously, and she
watched the man go up the steps to her house which
was another one of those big, old-fashioned, detached
ones, which peer out from between sky-scraping apartment
houses on the Drive, like Daniels in dens of
lions.</p>

<p>Gringo did not follow his master, but went under
the steps.</p>

<p>“Poor Grandmother,” said Stanna a few minutes
later. “He is in the library. She has run the shade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
away up&mdash;a storm signal. But I’m not going in yet,”
and she laughed as merrily as a child.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will, Stanna,” said my master decidedly,
“and I’m going with you. Come along.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, said something in
French that I did not catch, and went across the street
with him.</p>

<p>I ran first, and looked under the steps. “Hello!
Gringo, old boy&mdash;a thousand welcomes to Riverside
Drive.”</p>

<p>The old dog’s pleasure was lovely to see. He came
out, wagged his short tail, even licked me. “I feel
like a cat in a strange garret up here,” he growled.
“It’s fine to meet a friend. How have you been?
Why didn’t you call?”</p>

<p>“I was planning to come to-morrow,” I said. “I’ve
been in attendance on the best master a dog ever had.
He keeps me with him all the time.”</p>

<p>“He’s no better than mine,” said Gringo shortly.</p>

<p>“I’m dying to see your master,” I replied. “Come
in to this house. This is a place where dogs are
welcome.”</p>

<p>Gringo was just preparing to follow me up the steps,
when Sir Walter Scott stood before us&mdash;his tail rigid
with disapproval.</p>

<p>“Good land!” muttered Gringo in my ear, “another
one of these fool ’ristocrats. Mister’s gone batty on
the subject of swells. I wish he’d stayed on the Bowery.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Walter Scott in his mellifluous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
voice. “I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“This dog is a friend of mine, Scott,” I said bluntly,
“and I believe I have the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> of your house. In
insulting him, you insult me.”</p>

<p>Gringo was getting mad. “You high-toned dogs
palaver too much. See the teeth in those jaws,” and
he opened his gaping cavern of a mouth at Sir Walter
Scott. “They’re my cards. I’m going in&mdash;I want to
see master’s girl.”</p>

<p>Walter Scott stepped back with a sneer on his
handsome face, and was going for a walk in a somewhat
stiff-legged fashion, when Miss Stanna called,
“Come in, Walter darling.”</p>

<p>Walter darling was in a rage, but still he remembered
his manners, and stood back for Gringo and
me to follow Miss Stanna into the library.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">I MEET GRINGO AGAIN</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It was a very pleasant room. Old Mrs. Resterton
hadn’t expected callers, so the fire was very low
in order to save the coal. However, she was poking
it, and it soon would be cheerful. There were plenty
of books in long, low cases, and a nice old-rose carpet
on the floor, and big easy chairs. And standing before
one of those chairs was a very remarkable-looking
man.</p>

<p>He did look like Napoleon. He was proud, and
quiet and determined-looking, and his hair lay in a
little wave on his forehead, just the way Napoleon’s
does in his pictures. When he spoke, his voice was
beautiful&mdash;low and resonant like a bell. My! my!
what a look he had&mdash;like a man that had seen everything.
I saw that no matter what his position in life
had been, he was enormously clever.</p>

<p>Miss Stanna was very cool, and yet gracious with
him, but her grandmother, worldly old stager as she
was, could not conceal her satisfaction at his unexpected
visit.</p>

<p>She gushed when she saw my master. “Oh! Rudolph,
how opportune. I have been hoping you would
drop in. How are you, and how is dear Clossie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>He assured her that Clossie was well, and then she
said, “Mr. Bonstone, this is our friend of whom I was
speaking the other day&mdash;Mr. Granton.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands, and looked at each other
with sizing-up glances, like two dogs that may fight
and may not, just as the fancy strikes them.</p>

<p>Gringo went under the sofa with me, and Walter
Scott lay by the fire.</p>

<p>My! what a gossip we had. “Ain’t master the curly-headed
boy,” said Gringo admiringly. “Just up and
leaves the Bowery, and comes in among the swells,
as cool as a cucumber. Picks the downiest peach of
the lot.”</p>

<p>“But, Gringo,” I said uneasily. “You’ll not be at
home in these higher circles. You don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t understand,” he growled. “Don’t I understand?
Can you spring at a bull’s head, hold him,
and pin him down without sweating? That’s what my
ancestors used to do. I’m thoroughbred&mdash;I am. But
what they went through is nothing to what I’ve gone
through with these upper-crust dogs. It’s enough to
break your heart. At first I took their nonsense; then
I got my ginger up and just squared up to them. I
don’t see any use in their darned old politeness&mdash;forever
scraping and bowing, and doing the pretty. Yah!
it makes me sick.”</p>

<p>“How does your master get on?” I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Never turns a hair outside, but he’s hot under the
collar&mdash;wears four a day. This indoor life wilts him,
and makes him sweat like a butcher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Gringo, I thought your master was a saloon-keeper?”</p>

<p>“So he is, or was. He’s given up all his saloons,
and gone into real estate. He never stood behind a
bar himself. He hired other men for it. He was
always running the streets, making or dropping
money.”</p>

<p>“He looks interesting,” I said, poking my nose further
out from under the sofa to look at him.</p>

<p>“Interesting,” said Gringo scornfully, “he’s a whole
bag full of men in one. Watch that eyelid of his.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone had very fine eyes. They seemed to
talk without the aid of his lips. I noticed that though
he appeared to be taking his part in the conversation,
he scarcely opened his mouth.</p>

<p>“He’s a most intelligent listener,” I said, “but why
doesn’t he talk himself? Can’t he?”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of making a break,” said Gringo with
a sigh. “Used to gabbing with men. If he kept his
mouth open, something might slip out that would
frighten those two fashion-plates.”</p>

<p>“Does he really like Miss Stanna, or is he marrying
for social position?”</p>

<p>“He wants her,” said Gringo emphatically, “and
he wishes she was a barmaid.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see&mdash;he’s a man that doesn’t want to shine
in society.”</p>

<p>“If sassiety had one head, and master had a gun,
I wouldn’t leave him alone in the room with it,” remarked
Gringo shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘sassiety,’ Gringo,” I corrected. “Say
‘society.’”</p>

<p>He growled it over in his throat several times, and
at last got it right.</p>

<p>I was intensely interested in this affair, so I pushed
my enquiries further. “Does Miss Stanna know that
your master likes her for herself alone, and not because
she belongs to a good old New York family?”</p>

<p>“Can you fool a woman?” said Gringo scornfully.
“She knows all about it, and more too&mdash;but poor mister,
he’s in the dark. He thinks she’s marrying him
for his money, and he’s wondering whether she’ll ever
be willing to leave her gang for him.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she tell him?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t believe her now. You just hold on,
she’ll work that out for herself&mdash;I wish they’d get
married. I’m having the dickens of a time in an uptown
hotel. The dogs are enough to make you sick.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming to live in this Sweeney house after
the wedding?”</p>

<p>“You bet, and I’ll be glad to get up where it’s open,
but I say, old fellow, give us a helping hand with these
dogs up here, will you? Are they very stuck-up?”</p>

<p>“Some of them&mdash;I’ll get you good introductions.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nobby fellow,” said poor Gringo with a
roll of his eyes at me. “You know the ropes, and I
don’t. Mister’s got to be in society for a while, and
I’d like to get one paw in anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get your four feet in,” I said, rising, for I
saw master bending over Mrs. Resterton’s hand. “I’ll
run you as an eccentric dog of distinguished lineage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“You might tell them my record,” said Gringo anxiously.
“I licked Blangney Boy in 1912, and Handsome
Nick in 1913 and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the fighting will count much up
here,” I replied. “It will be more your manners, and
how much you are worth. You’ve got to run on your
master’s philanthropy, and his English ancestry. Don’t
mention his barmaid mother though.”</p>

<p>“Barmaids and barmen are just as good as anybody,”
said Gringo stoutly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know, but there’s a lot of temperance
sentiment up here, and if you just have to talk along
drinking lines, the wholesale brewery or distillery act
would take better than your retail trade. Just you
wait for your cue from me.”</p>

<p>Gringo’s eyes watered. “’Pon my word, I’m glad
I met you,” he said. “If ever you want a friend just
reckon on my jaws.”</p>

<p>“Try to make it up with Sir Walter Scott,” I said
anxiously. “He’s a leader in dog society about here,
though not a great favourite personally. It wasn’t
really etiquette for me to force you in, but I just had to
see your master.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not knuckle under to any dog,” said Gringo
decidedly. “Take every blow like a thoroughbred is
my motto, but when you once tackle, never give up
till they come in and pick you up.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t had any quarrel with him. Come
now, go over to him and say you’ve had a pleasant
call, and hope he may come to see you some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Gringo hesitated, then he shuffled over to the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>Walter got up as he saw him approaching and presently
I saw him lifting his upper lip in a dog smile.
He was satisfied.</p>

<p>“He will be a splendid friend to you,” I whispered
in Gringo’s ear, as they both approached me. “Cultivate
him, cultivate him.”</p>

<p>For a wonder, and to my disappointment, master
didn’t want to go for a further walk that evening. I
was a little troubled about him, as I ran home after
him. He was talking to himself, and sometimes he
smiled, and sometimes he frowned.</p>

<p>Arrived in our apartment, where his wife received
him with uplifted eyebrows, he did what he rarely
did&mdash;sat down beside her for a talk. There they were
each side of the little table, the electric light between
them.</p>

<p>“Clossie,” he said, “I believe Stanna is going to be
married.”</p>

<p>Phlegmatic as she was, the news of an engagement
always excited Mrs. Granton.</p>

<p>“To be married,” she repeated, “to whom?”</p>

<p>“To a fellow called Penny Nap&mdash;he used to keep a
saloon.”</p>

<p>“Penny Nap&mdash;is that all the name he has?”</p>

<p>“That is his nickname, his whole name is Norman
Bonstone.”</p>

<p>“Stanna&mdash;Penny Nap,” echoed Mrs. Granton in a
bewildered way.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” said my master crossly. “I believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the girl is being coerced. I can’t make her out;
perhaps you could. Clossie, will you go to see her?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clossie’s eyelids narrowed, as she stared at
her husband. “Oh! certainly. You think I can find
out whether she is happy about it? It’s a great thing
to have Stanna happy.”</p>

<p>Master didn’t say anything. He was dreaming, and
gazing into the fire.</p>

<p>The matter must have made an impression on Mrs.
Granton, for the next afternoon she announced her
intention of going to see the Restertons. Master telephoned,
found that they would be at home, then he
set out with his wife to walk the short distance to
their house.</p>

<p>Something was the matter with the car, and it had
been sent to the repair shop, unfortunately, oh! most
unfortunately.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MASTER GETS TWO SHOCKS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Master was very much pleased with his wife
for gratifying him, and he kept looking kindly
down at her as she waddled along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>She was all in fur&mdash;coat, muff and cap. Several
little baby seals must have starved to death, and several
mother seals must have died in agony to fit her
out.</p>

<p>She didn’t care, for one day I saw her read a story
about the cruel seal traffic, and throw it in the fire.
I knew what it was, for master told her about it, and
then handed it to her.</p>

<p>Well, just as we got opposite Stanna’s house, she
started to “jay-walk” across the street, as Gringo says&mdash;that
is, to cross it in the middle of a block.</p>

<p>Master caught her arm, and said, “Wait a minute&mdash;there
are too many cars passing.”</p>

<p>“They’ll stop when they see us,” she said impatiently,
and she pulled her arm away from him. He
tried to catch her again, but she was slippery in her
furs, then he got behind her, and literally tried to run
her across the street.</p>

<p>If she had only done as he wished her to do, but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
stopped short, as she saw a car bearing swiftly down
upon her, and screamed.</p>

<p>Now I do think automobiles are driven too fast in
many cases, but I have seen Louis get wild with excitement,
and say that he thinks he will lose his mind
over those persons who won’t use the crossings, and
who get right in front of his machine in the middle
of blocks.</p>

<p>Poor mistress, she didn’t know anything about the
trials of chauffeurs, and, in a flash, right there before
my eyes as I hesitated in the background, for something
told me what was coming&mdash;I saw her and my
dear master struck by a little coupé, rolled over and
over in the dust, and finally lying quite still.</p>

<p>I shrieked in agony, and a silly doglet who was
gazing from a window told me afterward that she
nearly died laughing to see me standing with one paw
uplifted as if I could help them.</p>

<p>The people in the coupé were nearly crazy. They
jumped out, lifted my master who was merely dazed,
then took up my poor mistress who was bleeding from
wounds on her pretty face, hurried her into a powerful
limousine that had stopped at sight of the accident,
and rushed her to a hospital.</p>

<p>I dashed after it, and kept it in sight till we got
near the hospital, where I sank on the ground, more
dead than alive.</p>

<p>After a long, long time my master came out. A
doctor took him in his car, I got in beside them, and
we drove sadly home.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a terribly unhappy time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for my master, and a mildly unhappy one for me.
The apartment was lonely without its mistress. She
had been selfish and disagreeable the most of the
time when she was there, but we missed her.</p>

<p>My master would sit and look at her empty chair,
his books and papers unheeded, then he would go to
the telephone.</p>

<p>She got over her wounds and bruises, but she didn’t
want to see my master. The doctors said her mind
seemed slightly affected&mdash;she had better go away off
in the country for treatment.</p>

<p>When this happened, there was a long silence from
her, broken only occasionally by a report from a physician.
Weeks and weeks went by. Miss Stanna got
married, and went to live in the big stone house, but
master never went near her, and his only recreation
was his long walks at night.</p>

<p>We got very near to each other in those days, and
Miss Stanna, or rather Mrs. Bonstone, meeting me in
the street one morning, stooped down and patted me,
saying, “You are a dear Boy-Dog; I don’t know what
poor Rudolph would do without you.”</p>

<p>This pleased me immensely, and I stuck to my
dear master closer than ever. Some of his friends
were losing money by the war, but his business had
improved, and the more money he made, the more he
gave away.</p>

<p>Many a poor man blessed him for the help he
rendered. The unemployment was dreadful, and the
ones master helped were just the ones that the agencies
for poor men did not touch. One night he kept a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
poor fellow from drowning himself in the Hudson.
Master argued with him for an hour, and finally
brought him home and had him sleep in his own bed.
The poor lad was a gentleman and a foreigner, and
was too proud to let his people know the plight he
was in.</p>

<p>Some nights we cut across the city to Ellen’s
avenue. It did us both good to go there. That Ellen
was the dearest old soul I ever saw, and I loved to
talk to Beanie now. I never saw such a changed dog.
We used to tramp up the six flights of stairs to her
flat, and when Beanie felt that we were coming, he
would fly out of Ellen’s soft lap, and stand whining at
the door, so we always found them waiting for us.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_100">Beanie was quite handsome now</a>. He had lost much
of his flesh, and had quite a slender dog figure. Some
one had told Ellen how valuable he was, and she was
just eaten up with pride to think that she had such a
well-bred dog.</p>

<div id="Fig_100" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEANIE WAS QUITE HANDSOME NOW</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were a good many coloured people on the
avenue, and they all petted Beanie, but instead of getting
more stuck-up and proud, he had become quite
a humble dog.</p>

<p>He used to talk to me by the hour, and tell me
how kind Ellen and Robert Lee were to him. While
master was talking to old Ellen, and despite himself,
letting her know what some of his troubles were,
Beanie would ask me questions about his dear mistress.</p>

<p>On this particular evening he had been talking as
he often did about her accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beanie,” I said, “she wasn’t a true friend to you;
why are you so sorry?”</p>

<p>“She brought me up,” he said. “She owned me.
I can’t help loving her better than any one in the
world.”</p>

<p>“But she is a very poor sort of a tool&mdash;now you
know she is.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference,” he said, shaking
his head, “she was my mistress.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” I said, “but I’m not that
kind of a dog. I can’t love persons unless I respect
them.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know yet what true dog love is,”
said Beanie. “I’d rather be unhappy with my dear
Mrs. Granton than to be happy here with Ellen.”</p>

<p>“Is it because she is rich, and you like luxury?” I
asked in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“No, no. If Mrs. Granton were Ellen, and Ellen
were Mrs. Granton, it would be all the same.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said stoutly, “I’m glad you can’t live
with her, for she would have killed you by this time
with over-rich food.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have minded dying for her,” said Beanie
simply.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “it takes all kinds of dogs to fit
the different kinds of owners,” and I ran to my own
dear friend who was saying good-bye to Ellen in a
depressed fashion.</p>

<p>Evidently he had been telling her that the blessing
she had promised him had been changed into something
else, for she was saying earnestly, “Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the wheels of the Lord’s chariot run slow, dear Sir,
sometimes fast, but dey always roll. Dey never stand
still. You jes’ wait an’ hope. I feel as if somethin’
great was jes’ a-hangin’ over you now.”</p>

<p>Master raised his hand, and a soft light fell on
his handsome face from Ellen’s single, dim gas jet&mdash;That’s
another thing poor people don’t have enough
of&mdash;good light.</p>

<p>“Ellen,” he said, “if it ever does come, I’ll remember
you.”</p>

<p>He talked to himself a good deal, when we started
on our way home. We were taking our usual route
now&mdash;that is, through Morningside Park which we
climbed just under Cathedral Heights. We were getting
home much earlier than usual, and there was an
evening service just closing in the huge church which
dominates this part of the city.</p>

<p>As we took the path which winds round the back
of it, where the workmen chip the stone all day, and
will for many days to come (for it will take years
to finish the structure) an exquisite sound floated out
on the night air.</p>

<p>Through some unfinished part of the building, this
boy’s voice reached us&mdash;so clear, and sweet and promising.
It soared by us, and right up to the stars.</p>

<p>Master started, looked at first disturbed, then comforted.
He stopped short, gave one backward glance
at the vast tract of brightly lighted city seen from this
eminence, then walked quickly toward a side door of
the cathedral, near one of the exquisite little chapels.</p>

<p>I had often been here before with him, but always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in the daytime, and he had made me wait for him
outside, hidden behind some of the big blocks of stone.</p>

<p>However, to-night I pressed in after him, and
he did not rebuke me. I knew a church was no place
for dogs, but I was uneasy about my dear master, and
did not want to leave him alone.</p>

<p>As he pushed open the swing door, such a blast of
music met us. The whole thing was going now&mdash;organ
and men’s voices, and it was magnificent.</p>

<p>Dogs like music as well as human beings do. Nothing
entertains me more when I am tired than to have
some lady sing and play the piano, and even a victrola
is better than dead quiet.</p>

<p>Well, my master walked heavily in through the
little door, and skirting the small chapels, went away
down to the end of the church and took one of the
last seats near the big doors.</p>

<p>There he sat down&mdash;poor, weary man, and laid his
head on the back of the chair in front of him.</p>

<p>His soft hat rolled away in a corner, and I picked
it up and put it on the seat next him. Then I sneaked
in close to his feet.</p>

<p>He was making the low, soft noise that some people
make in churches, for I have often stolen into them.
This seemed to comfort him. The music rose and
fell, and the boy’s voice soared and soared till in that
evening hour, it seemed to be full of unnatural beauty
and appeal.</p>

<p>It was almost dark where we were. A few of the
lights high up in the cathedral were going, but we
were far away, and they scarcely reached us. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
organ went on after the human voices stopped&mdash;oh! the
lovely music&mdash;sometimes soft and low, then high, and
clear and sweet, and sometimes grumbling, like the
waves of the sea in a storm.</p>

<p>I am only a dog, but the music told a story to me.
I ran over all my past life, my ups and downs, my
sorrows and delights&mdash;and I thought, if this means
so much to me, when I understand it only on the surface,
what must it mean to the weary, clever human
being beside me.</p>

<p>After a time, the organ stopped. I think the organist
had been having a good time to himself after
the choir-boys had gone. Then a very strange thing
happened. A voice sounded through the cathedral&mdash;a
warm, persuasive voice, addressing all that army of
vacant chairs.</p>

<p>My master started, and raised his head for a minute.
Then it sank again. Afterward, I heard the explanation.
A preacher who had come from a long way
off, had heard of the teasing echo in the cathedral,
and he was testing his voice. Every word he said
seemed to be repeated. The immense building now
looks as if it were cut in two, for it is only half
finished. When it is quite done in years to come,
the echo, it is said, will disappear.</p>

<p>I did not understand the words, but my master did.
He listened intently, and I, who had got to know
him so well, knew that a change was coming over his
spirit. He was being comforted.</p>

<p>After a while the preacher followed the organist,
and left the cathedral, but still my master did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
go home. I might have pulled his coat and reminded
him of the passage of time, but I judged that this
was not a case for my interference. I kept curled up
on his feet, so they would not get chilled from the
stone pavement, and there we sat, hour after hour, till
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>After a time I felt his feet stirring, then he got up,
found his hat, and groping his way to the big doors,
began to walk up and down, up and down, very slowly
and thoughtfully. I went to a corner and lay down,
and it did not seem very long before the doors were
opened for an early service. We were free. I gave
him a long, searching glance, as we emerged from
the cathedral grounds to broad Amsterdam Avenue.
He was a different man. Something had happened in
the church.</p>

<p>With a firm, free stride, he struck across the avenue,
past Columbia University and Broadway to the Drive.
He was in a terrible hurry to get home.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said looking down at me with a light on
his face I had not seen there since the accident to
my mistress, “it’s all right now&mdash;happiness or sorrow.
I shall not repine, but I feel as if we were going
to receive good news.”</p>

<p>I was so glad he said “we” and not “I.” It made
me feel a part of his family. I had to run to keep
up with him at last. It seemed as if he could not
go fast enough. When we got to the apartment
house, and he entered the elevator which was always
too speedy a one for my comfort, he acted as if he
thought it was going slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>He whipped out his latch-key, and stepped very
quickly to the parlour, and there on the table that
always stood between him and his wife, lay a telegram.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">NAPOLEON AND THE WASP</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">He tore open the telegram, exclaimed “Thank
God,” clapped his hat on, slammed the door
in my face, and was gone&mdash;all inside a minute.</p>

<p>What had happened, that he had forgotten me?
I screamed with rage and disappointment, and
scratched at the door, a thing I rarely do, for nothing
makes human beings so annoyed as to have their doors
marked by dogs.</p>

<p>The cook and the waitress came running from the
kitchen. They were very good friends of mine, for
I took care to treat them with the respect and consideration
that every well-bred dog should show to
servants. I always wiped my feet on muddy days, and
I never went into the kitchen without an invitation.</p>

<p>“Bless the beast&mdash;what’s up with him?” exclaimed
cook.</p>

<p>“Something, you may be sure,” said the waitress.
“He’s got sense, that dog has. I guess the old man
has gone and left him.”</p>

<p>I pulled cook’s cotton dress with my teeth. I led
her to the telegram, and nosed it over to her. Alas!
I could not read it. That bit of paper had driven
master from his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Cook caught it up, and then gave a screech. “She’s
gone and done it&mdash;doesn’t that jostle you!”</p>

<p>What had who done&mdash;mistress I supposed&mdash;why
didn’t she tell me, and I whined and howled; but they
paid no attention to me till Louis came in for his
orders, as he usually did at this time in the morning,
not sauntering, but hurrying and breathing heavily
as if he too were excited.</p>

<p>There was a queer smirk on his face, and he opened
his mouth to speak, but he had no chance to say anything
for the two women just yelled at him, “We’ve
got a baby&mdash;we’re just like other folks&mdash;read that&mdash;ain’t
it the superfine!”</p>

<p>Now I thought I would go crazy. I barked, and
jumped, and screamed, and no one rebuked me.</p>

<p>Cook sat down in mistress’s chair and fanned herself
with her apron, Annie the waitress took master’s chair
and drummed her fingers on the table, and Louis sat
on the fender-stool with his cap on and whistled.</p>

<p>“Let’s have our coffee in here,” said cook, so they
had a lovely time by the fire, and talked about the
coming of the baby, and how it would turn the family
topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>“The old man wasn’t in last night, was he?” remarked
Louis.</p>

<p>“No,” said cook, “he wasn’t&mdash;something new for
him.”</p>

<p>“That kid elevator boy gave me some mouth about
it,” said Louis sheepishly.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” asked Annie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grinned like a fool, and asked me where my old
man got that dust on his coat and hat.”</p>

<p>I whined eagerly. Oh, if I could only speak, and
tell them it was cathedral dust. Rich people don’t
know what sharp-eyed critics they have in their dogs,
and cats and servants.</p>

<p>“I hope you gave him a smack,” said Annie.</p>

<p>“Bet yer life, didn’t I,” said Louis. “Says I, ‘Young
feller, if my old man was out all night, he in no mischief
were&mdash;he ain’t that colour&mdash;see!’ and I digged
him under the ribs.”</p>

<p>Cook and Annie shrieked with laughter, and said
they’d have their dig at the elevator boy too, then
finally they all went to their work. Cook invited me
politely to sit in the kitchen, but after my breakfast
I ran to master’s room and sat on the window seat
looking up and down the Drive. I waited for him
till late in the afternoon. Then I knew he would be
better pleased to have me taking the air, so I ran to
the hall door, and barked till Annie opened it. The
elevator boy took me down below, and the door-man
let me out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant day with a brisk wind sweeping in
off the Hudson. Many nurses and children were out,
and many dogs. I knew all the canines in this neighbourhood
by sight now, and had a speaking acquaintance
with all those worth knowing. I ran into one of
the little parks, and there saw a group of dogs without
leashes who were standing talking together, and gazing
at a Dachshund who was conceitedly staring in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
what he thought was the direction of Germany, but
what was really Hoboken.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, boys,” I said, “what’s the news?”</p>

<p>“We’re just deciding which of us shall have the
pleasure of licking that hyphenated-American dog,”
said a handsome, black French bulldog. “For days
he’s been pushing that griffon Bruxelles about, and
some of us think it’s time for us to stand up for the
Belgian dog. To-day, the news of the war has been
very good for the Germans, and the Dachshund has
been positively unbearable.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have the honour of settling him,” said
an Irish wolfhound, “but the odds wouldn’t be even.”</p>

<p>A Scotch terrier bristled up, “I maunna, canna, winna
yield the privilege to none. I hae it.”</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” said a Welsh terrier angrily.</p>

<p>I burst out laughing. “Fight him if you like.
You’ll fight me after.”</p>

<p>They stared at me, and the Dachshund threw me a
grateful glance.</p>

<p>“This is a free country for dogs as well as men,”
I said. “Let him talk. Don’t listen, if you don’t
like what he says.”</p>

<p>“Are you a pro-German?” enquired an English bulldog
furiously.</p>

<p>“If you are, I’ll chew you up,” an Irish terrier seconded
him.</p>

<p>In reality, I am a dog that is for the Allies, but I
wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of telling them.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen dogs,” I said, “I’m not talking about
who I’m for, or who I’m against&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should say ‘whom,’” interjected an English
setter who was a great purist as regards dog language.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said bowing to him, “I’m for free
speech. Say what you like, as long as you’re not insulting.”</p>

<p>“He was insulting,” said the whole group of dogs.
“He said that Riverside Drive would soon be German.”</p>

<p>“That’s not insulting,” I replied, “why, that’s flattering.
Think what a nice place it must be, if the
Germans want it.”</p>

<p>Every dog showed his teeth&mdash;I don’t know what
the upshot would have been, if their various owners
had not called them and put their muzzles on. While
we had been gossiping, the ladies had been talking
together. They were very nice ladies, and law-abiding
in general, but they did so hate the muzzle law, and
were so sorry to see their poor dogs pawing their
noses in misery, that they had the habit of carrying the
muzzles in their hands, and slipping them on the dogs
when they saw a policeman coming. It certainly was
absurd to see baby spaniels, and toy dogs of all kinds
with muzzles on their tiny noses. They couldn’t have
bitten hard if they had tried.</p>

<p>As the dogs who had been growling about the
Dachshund left, they threw furious backward glances
at the conceited little scamp who ran up to me, and
licked gratefully a little piece of mud off my back.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Danke schön</i>,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Can’t you control yourself a bit?” I asked, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
not be so indiscreet? There wasn’t a German dog in
that crowd. You’d have had a bite or two, if I hadn’t
come along.”</p>

<p>“It was for the Fatherland,” he exclaimed, “and
the sacred domestic hearth prized by dogs as well as
men.”</p>

<p>“You say that like a little parrot,” I remarked, “and
I don’t believe you bullied that griffon on your own
responsibility. You’ve always been a good dog up
to within a week. Who’s been coaching you?”</p>

<p>The little dog instead of answering, looked mad,
and nipped me quite quickly on the hind leg.</p>

<p>“Oh! you saucy hyphen,” I said&mdash;his name was
Grosvater-Leinchen, and I rolled him over and over
a few times in the dust, like a little four-legged worm.</p>

<p>He got up, looking very dusty, and shook himself.</p>

<p>“Who’s been debauching you?” I said fiercely.
“Come on now&mdash;I can bite as well as any dog,” and
I showed him two rows of strong teeth.</p>

<p>“If I make new friends, it’s no business of yours,”
he said sulkily.</p>

<p>“Oho!” I said. “I know now. It’s that new German
police dog that has come to the Drive. So he
told you the patter about the domestic hearth. Now
I’ll tell you something more. He’s a stranger, he
doesn’t fit in here. You’re a New Yorker, and subject
to the law of the Drive, which is that a dog must
function.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,” he said irritably.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve got to fit in here, and play the
game. You must respect the rights of other dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and not impose your little Dachshund will on us. Did
you ever hear of liberty, equality, fraternity?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said in an ugly little voice, that told me
the spell of the police dog was still upon him.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “for you, that means that if the
griffon gets here first, and wants the warmest patch
of sunlight, you’ve got to let him have it. You’ve
no business to drive him out.”</p>

<p>“But I’m a bigger dog,” he said in surprise, “and
I’m German. He’s only a Belgian.”</p>

<p>“Oho! that’s it, is it?” I replied. “You think German
dogs lead the universe.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do.”</p>

<p>“Well then, if they do, they ought to be perfect.”</p>

<p>“They are perfect,” he said in astonishment.
“Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I didn’t. I believed American dogs,
and English dogs, and even coloured dogs, are just
as good as German dogs, if they behave themselves.”</p>

<p>“You’re a socialist,” he said, “a dangerous dog.”</p>

<p>I stared at his ridiculous, little, short-legged swagger,
as he swung up and down before me.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to tell you something,” I said, “as
force alone appeals to you. That little griffon belongs,
as you probably know, to Mrs. Warrington
whose sister married an Englishman&mdash;Lord Alstone.
Now I happen to know that Lady Alstone is to arrive
here to-morrow on a visit to her sister, and with her
ladyship comes her English mastiff. You’re probably
going to get the greatest licking a dog ever got, for
the griffon and the mastiff are always very chummy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and he will be sure to tell of the treatment he has
been receiving from you. A family dog will fight you
far harder than outsiders like the Drive dogs.”</p>

<p>The Dachshund looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you,” I said, “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">auf wiedersehen</i>.”</p>

<p>“I say,” he exclaimed hopping after me, “I don’t
want to be torn to pieces.”</p>

<p>“How can you be,” I retorted, “you’re perfect&mdash;being
a super-dog, you’ll find a way out.”</p>

<p>“If that mastiff hurts me, the police dog will kill
him,” he said angrily.</p>

<p>“Ah! perhaps,” I observed. “Of course the police
dog is a good size, but an English mastiff&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Dachshund looked still more thoughtful. “I
believe I’ll let the griffon have the sunny corner in
future,” he said. “After all, I’m not living in Germany.
I’ll tell the police dog I’ve got to be American,
as long as I’m here. If I go back to Germany, I can
be German.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I said heartily. “That’s a wise dog.
Now why don’t you run right on to the griffon’s house,
and tell him that? Get your story in before the mastiff
arrives.”</p>

<p>Off hopped Mr. Dachshund across the Drive, keeping
a bright look-out for policemen, and I felt that in
future he would be friendly with the griffon.</p>

<p>I chuckled to myself, as I ran on to the Bonstones,
for that was my objective point. Evil communications
corrupt good manners even in dogs.</p>

<p>The air was delicious. I had no muzzle on, so I
went slowly, and with a wary eye for those nice men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the police, who would be our best friends if it weren’t
for the health commissioner. It is a great fashion with
some persons to run down policemen. I always like
them and firemen, and have no admiration whatever
for soldiers. I hate to see things torn and mangled.
Policemen and firemen try to keep things together,
and I believe if every policeman in every big city had
a good police dog, there would be less killing and
wounding of human beings.</p>

<p>The New York policemen are sharp, so I had to do
a good deal of dodging behind pillars and in shrubbery,
and twice I had to run away down to the river
bank to elude them. It was close on dinner time,
when I reached the Bonstone mansion.</p>

<p>I ran round to the back to get in. Fortunately the
chauffeur, who was a friend of Louis, knew me, and
when I whined, he left the car he was cleaning in
the garage, and opening a side door of the house,
said, “Run in, purp&mdash;I’ll bet you’ve come to call on
the bride.”</p>

<p>I had, and I ran through back halls and passages
right up to her bed-room. She was dressing, not for
her own dinner only, but for a fancy dress ball to be
held in the house of a friend afterward. She looked
like the most beautiful picture I ever saw. Most
women don’t look like pictures, but she nearly always
does. She was putting on the costume Sir Walter had
told me about&mdash;the wasp creation, with the gauzy
wings and fluffy flounces. The skirt was rather short,
and showed pretty striped stockings&mdash;yellow and black,
Sir Walter said they were. Then there were tiny little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
satin shoes&mdash;oh! she certainly was very gauzy, and
waspy and pretty.</p>

<p>Miss Stanna, or perhaps I should now say Mrs. Bonstone,
had a French maid dressing her&mdash;a well-trained
one, for her mistress had scarcely to open her lips to
give directions.</p>

<p>Once she murmured, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trop serrée</i>;” and another
time she said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les gants jaunes</i>.”</p>

<p>Her flowers were lovely&mdash;orchids that nodded like
big insects, and looked the shade of her gown.</p>

<p>When she glided from the room, the maid, who
was a merry-looking creature herself, stared after her,
and said with quite an English accent, “She knows how
to get herself up&mdash;the monkey.”</p>

<p>Her voice was kind when she said it. We dogs
don’t take much stock in words; it’s the tone that
counts with us.</p>

<p>I don’t believe Mrs. Bonstone would ever be unkind
to any one, unless they deserved a good scolding, in
which case I think she could give it.</p>

<p>Well, I travelled on behind the wasp gown down to
the drawing-room. Mrs. Bonstone had greeted me politely,
when I went in, but very dreamily. Her alert
mind was not at present on dogs.</p>

<p>Sir Walter stood under the statue of a Grecian boy
in the lower hall, and as usual was the essence of courtesy.
He came forward to greet me, bowing his noble
head politely, and never saying a word about my not
having called sooner, escorted me into the fine, big
room, which had been done over with furnishings in
which a lot of gold glittered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must have cost thousands and thousands,” I observed.</p>

<p>Sir Walter, who did not think it good manners to
mention prices of things, and yet who felt it incumbent
on him to say something, murmured merely, “The new
man is princely in his generosity.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Gringo?” I inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Never leaves his master&mdash;look behind Mr. Bonstone’s
patent leather shoes.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was old Gringo, resplendent in
a new collar which seemed to worry his neck, and panting
happily beside a big fire. He looked like a big,
ugly, brindled splotch on the white velvet hearth rug,
but attractive, so very attractive, and just brimful of
originality. He wasn’t going to turn into a conventional
dog, just because he had come to live on Riverside
Drive.</p>

<p>He pricked his rose ears when he saw me, and
scuffed over to nose, or rather to lip me a welcome,
for his old nose had such a lay-back that it wasn’t the
use to him that mine was, for example. Mr. Bonstone
and his wife didn’t pay any attention to us. They
were staring at each other, as if they were at some
kind of new and agreeable entertainment. However,
the man’s keen glance soon fell on us.</p>

<p>“Dog-show?” he asked agreeably. “I heard there
was one going on.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone laughed in a healthy, happy way, as
if she hadn’t a care in the world. Something about
us&mdash;we three dogs standing in the middle of the room,
politely greeting each other, seemed to excite her risibles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
till she almost lost control of herself. Or was
there something back of us in her mind? I guessed the
latter by the way she looked at her husband when
she caught his arm and said, “Norman, let’s go in to
dinner.”</p>

<p>The butler, who stood in the doorway, was just announcing
this, the most agreeable time of the day. He
was a new man, and gave me a frightful stare. I placed
him as a dog-hater.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone and his wife took their dinner in almost
profound silence. Whether it was the presence
of the servants in the room or not, I don’t know, but
they seemed to be quite happy without talking.</p>

<p>After dinner they went, not back to the drawing-room,
but to the smoking-room, which was furnished
in quiet, dull colours. There were some big, leather-covered
chairs by the fire, and Mr. Bonstone sat down
in one, and resting his head on the back of it, stared
at the ceiling, while his wife wandered about the room.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Bonstone nor my master smoked, and
for that I was very thankful, for though I can stand
the smell of tobacco I, like most normal dogs, do not
care for the smell of anything burning. I love strong
odours, but not when they are on fire.</p>

<p>We dogs were ordered to go to the kitchen to get
some dinner, and when we came back, the Bonstones
were talking, but not about anything interesting to me,
so I had a little conversation with Gringo.</p>

<p>We were going under the table which was covered
with books and magazines. Underneath was a fine
Turkish rug which made the floor very comfy, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was just going to lie down on it, when Mrs. Bonstone
said politely, “Lie by the fire, Boy, you are an honoured
guest.”</p>

<p>I had begged Sir Walter to leave us for a while.
He was thoroughly exhausted, having had a twenty-mile
tramp with Mr. Bonstone that afternoon, and
though he urged that his duties as host demanded that
he stay till my call was over, I freed him from all
obligations of a social nature, and told him to run
off for forty winks, and come back refreshed.</p>

<p>Gringo and I were not sorry to be alone. “If I
could tell you, old fellow,” I whispered in his soft, well
set-up ear, “how sorry I’ve been not to take you about
a bit and introduce you, but my master needed me, and
I was consoled by hearing that Walter Scott was doing
the handsome thing by you.”</p>

<p>“That dog’s right on the level,” said Gringo heartily.
“He’s not used to my sort. In that castle in
Scotland, where he was born, there was a set of dog-nobs.
He never ran with common dogs till I came,
but as he said himself, ‘My dear mistress sets the pace
in this house&mdash;if she accepts you, it is my duty to accept
you, too.’”</p>

<p>“He has introduced you properly to our set, hasn’t
he?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“He has done it fine. I know the whole bunch from
those babies in arms, the toy spaniels, up to the biggest
mastiff that stalks the Drive.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of them?”</p>

<p>“I hate most of them,” said Gringo stoutly, “can’t
make ’em out. On the Bowery, we’re honest&mdash;if a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dog likes you, you’re made aware of it. If he hates
you, he lies low for you.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we’re deceitful up here,” I said with
a troubled air.</p>

<p>“Deceitful ain’t the name for it. They smile and
scrape, and give a polite look in the eye, but I’m dead
sure they’re grinning behind my back. I’ll never like
these up-town dogs. Me for the simple life and
honesty.”</p>

<p>I said nothing. What he affirmed was partly true,
but he was over-suspicious. The trouble was, his manners
weren’t right, and his sub-conscious self told him
he was not in his proper <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</i>.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said, “I note you’re as well-known
as the cops. How did you fix that with so many dogs
about? You’ve not been here long.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said with a smile. “It’s easy for
me to make friends. I don’t usually stay long in a
place, and it’s get acquainted in a hurry, or not at
all&mdash;a sort of ‘dogs-that-pass-in-the-night’ fashion.”</p>

<p>“Some day I want to swap experiences with you,”
he said.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You like your present crib, don’t you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Rather, but I’m worried about my master just
now.”</p>

<p>Gringo wasn’t listening to me. “Hush up, old man,
for a bit,” he said anxiously. “I believe that girl is
wasping master again.”</p>

<p>I looked over my shoulder. Mrs. Bonstone had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
wiggled on to the arm of the huge chair her husband
was sitting in.</p>

<p>“Odd, isn’t it, Norman,” she was saying, “that you
so love this conventional life after all your Bohemianism.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norman gave her a queer look from his expressive
eyes, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“I should think you would hate evening dress and
tight shoes and dinners and dances, after the prairies
and South America and&mdash;the Bowery.”</p>

<p>“Master’s in a cold perspiration; he don’t like those
things&mdash;he hates ’em as much as I do,” said Gringo
indignantly, “but he thinks she likes ’em, so he keeps
his mouth shut.”</p>

<p>In listening to him, I lost Mr. Bonstone’s reply,
and Gringo went on wrathfully, “Ain’t she the limit!
She sits there night after night and sticks pins in my
poor boss, and he thinks she’s cute and clever.”</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t understand her any more than
you do the Riverside dogs,” I said. “Looks to me
as if she liked him.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Gringo, “why don’t she tell him so,
instead of wasping his life out?”</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “some ladies often wrap truth all
round with affectations, till it’s like a little lost soul
in the centre of a big ball.”</p>

<p>“Then give me just plain women,” said the old dog
sulkily.</p>

<p>“Norman,” Mrs. Bonstone was saying, “how would
you like to give a ball. We’ve got to return some of
the hospitality that’s been showered on us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor kid master,” groaned Gringo, “he goes to
those fool shows, and watches her dancing, and buttons
and unbuttons his gloves, and chokes his yawns, and
thinks he’s having a good time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone was speaking. “Stanna&mdash;you may
give a ball, or a funeral, or anything you choose. I’ll
foot the bill.”</p>

<p>She struck her gaudy heels together, and said nothing
for a long time.</p>

<p>Her maid came in, laid a wonderful evening cloak
on the back of a chair, and withdrew.</p>

<p>The sight of it seemed to irritate Mrs. Bonstone,
for she frowned at it, and after a time, stretched out
her hand, pulled the lovely cloak from the back of
the chair near her, threw it over Gringo and me, and
disdainfully tucked it round us with her foot.</p>

<p>Gringo was nearly dead with the heat of the fire,
and as he wriggled out of the cloak, he muttered
wrathfully, “Why don’t the boss give her a hauling
over the coals? Down on the Bowery, she’d get it,
and be the better for it. The way men fetch and carry
for the ladies in the ‘aileet of the bowe mond,’ makes
me sick!”</p>

<p>I snickered at his French, then turned my attention
to Mr. Bonstone who was saying quietly, “You’ve
changed your mind about going to that fancy dress affair
to-night, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have,” she said dreamily, and she slipped
from the arm of his chair to another big one, and
sinking back in it, fixed her eyes on the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you a farm somewhere near here?” she
asked presently.</p>

<p>An eager look came into Mr. Bonstone’s eyes.
“Yes,” he said shortly. “I have.”</p>

<p>“Let’s pretend we’re the farmer and his wife,” she
said coaxingly. “I’ve just been out to the stable, and
put the hens to bed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone smiled. “Suppose we say hen-house,”
he remarked. “Hens, as a rule, don’t sleep in the
stable.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;the hen-house,” she said. “You’ve just been
milking the cows.”</p>

<p>“I can milk,” said Mr. Bonstone, “but I don’t count
on ever doing it myself.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Mrs. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t pay&mdash;I’d better do the head-work, and
have a man attend to the cows.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone pressed her pretty lips together, and
went on, “The horses, the cows and the hens are all
asleep. What would the farmer and his wife do to
amuse themselves for the evening?”</p>

<p>“I know what the farmer would do,” said Mr. Bonstone,
“he’d tot up his accounts, read the paper, and
go to bed. He’d be dead tired.”</p>

<p>“And what would I do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You’d do likewise, if you were a real farmer’s
wife,” said Mr. Bonstone. “Your feet would be so
sore, you couldn’t stand on them.”</p>

<p>“How lovely!” she exclaimed, “to be really tired.”</p>

<p>“What set you out to talk about this?” he inquired
curiously. “You’d never live on a farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” she replied earnestly, “I’m tired of
balls, I’m tired of the opera, I’m tired of dances, I’m
tired of dinners, I’m tired of fine dresses&mdash;I’m tired
of everything I’ve had. I want something new.”</p>

<p>“If you want novelty,” he said breathlessly, “I’ve
got that farm&mdash;I never thought you’d go on it.”</p>

<p>“I want to go there,” she said. “I want to leave
here. I want chickens and cows and more dogs.”</p>

<p>“You’d miss this life,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“No, no, I would not. I long for the country&mdash;the
real country&mdash;let Grandmother have this house.”</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t she the ice-chest,” observed Gringo
severely.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone’s eyes were going round the room.
I felt what he was thinking of. Worldly-wise old Mrs.
Resterton would be enchanted to preside over this mansion.</p>

<p>“If she comes here,” he said at last, “you must come,
too, when you like. You are a city girl, the country
will bore you after a time.”</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture. “You don’t understand.
I like what you like. You despise bricks and
mortar, I despise them.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I haven’t money enough to run two
houses,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t care&mdash;I can work,” and she opened out
her two tiny hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone said nothing, and looked down at
Gringo.</p>

<p>“Believe me, he’s happy,” muttered the old dog in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
my ear. “I see it in his eyes. He thinks the Wasp
is beginning to like him.”</p>

<p>“I thought you liked money,” said Mr. Bonstone
after a long time.</p>

<p>“I love it,” said the Wasp promptly, “heaps of it,
but I like you better.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to do something now,” said Gringo anxiously.
“He’s very chilly in his ways.”</p>

<p>A red-hot spark just then flew out of the fire on
my coat, and I was very much occupied with my little
burn for a few seconds. When I again turned my
attention to the room, Gringo was on his feet ejaculating
excitedly, “Mister’s left his chair&mdash;he’s walking,
fast round the room&mdash;he’s powerfully pleased&mdash;come
on, let’s join the procession,” and he gambolled to the
other side of the table.</p>

<p>I love to see human beings happy, and I trotted after
Gringo. Mrs. Bonstone’s face shone like a fairy’s,
and she was softly beating her hands on the arms of
her chair.</p>

<p>“Never again tell me your master has cold eyes,” I
said to Walter Scott, who had just come to the room,
and stood in the doorway gazing in an amazed and
disapproving manner at the cloak on the floor, his
master’s excited face, and Mrs. Bonstone’s resplendent
eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear lady is not going to the ball,” faltered Sir
Walter&mdash;“she’s lost her repose of manner, and she’s
singing, ‘Tum Tum,’ and beating her hands on the
chair&mdash;what would Grandmother say, if she were
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fortunately, Grandmother is in Palm Beach,” I
muttered.</p>

<p>Gringo was in high feather. As he trailed round the
room after his master, and I trailed after him, he said
gleefully, “Thank goodness, young missie has quit her
fooling. She’s let mister know she wants to do whatever
he wants to do. Now he won’t be so bothered.
He can get to work to carry out his schemes for improving
country life without having to gloom round
after her all the time.”</p>

<p>A thought came flashing into my mind. “Oh! if
my poor master only had his sick wife home again&mdash;I
believe he would look just as blissful as Mr. Bonstone
does.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE GREAT SECRET</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Just as I thought this, wonderful to relate, the
door was pushed wholly open, and there stood
master. His face was on fire&mdash;all lit up by his blazing
eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp rose pretty quickly to her feet, although
master had seemed to take no note of her excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ve got such news,” he said, “I couldn’t wait to
be announced. Stanna, I’ve got a son&mdash;a little son.”</p>

<p>“A baby,” she screamed&mdash;“impossible&mdash;you’re
dreaming,” and she went up to him, and shook him.</p>

<p>“It’s true, true,” he said, and he stared at Mr. Bonstone
who had grasped his hand and was shaking it
heartily.</p>

<p>“Take your hat off, take your hat off,” ejaculated
Mrs. Bonstone, and her husband helping her, they
pushed my dear master into the middle chair by the fire,
and sat down each side of him.</p>

<p>Here he was at home in the heart of his friends,
and one of them he had seen only once before. But
that made no difference. If Mr. Bonstone had had a
brother, he could not have surveyed him more affectionately
than he was surveying my dear master.</p>

<p>I was licking his shoes, his hands&mdash;I was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
crazy with delight, and even Gringo and Walter Scott
were grinning.</p>

<p>“Now, tell us all about it,” said Mrs. Wasp, clapping
her hands, “but first, are you hungry? You look as
pale as a ghost. When did you last have something
to eat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said master faintly.</p>

<p>“The bell, Norman,” she said. “Quick now, Jeannie,”
she said to the maid who appeared almost instantaneously;
“a tray right here&mdash;soup, tea and toast,
for the present. In two hours we will have supper
in the dining-room&mdash;chicken salad, cold meats, hot
rolls, anything else nice that cook can get us.”</p>

<p>Master, who was listening, murmured, “How very
kind you are, Stanna.”</p>

<p>“No, Rudolph, not kind,” she said sweetly. “Just
returning some of your many attentions to a tiresome
girl. Now, tell us about it&mdash;tell us. You’re quite
sure about the baby, you’re not deluded&mdash;that would
be too cruel.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen it, handled it,” said master starting up
in his chair and pushing his hair back from his forehead
with both hands&mdash;a trick he had when he was
greatly excited. “It’s a beauty.”</p>

<p>“Boy or girl?” cried Stanna.</p>

<p>“Boy.”</p>

<p>“And Clossie&mdash;tell us about her. I thought she was
so very ill.”</p>

<p>“She has been. She is worn to a shadow. Her flesh
is gone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Clossie thin!” ejaculated Mrs. Bonstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a wraith. I scarcely knew her. She hid her
face from me, the poor child. She cried&mdash;she thinks
she is disfigured for life. She, the mother of my child.
I tell you, she’s glorious&mdash;absolutely glorious. I never
saw a more beautiful woman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone exchanged a glance with her husband.
Master was frightfully excited. Then she passed a
hand over her forehead.</p>

<p>That was a hint to her husband not to excite their
friend, and the poor man had never opened his lips.
Ladies are queer, even the best of them.</p>

<p>To cap the climax, she said, “Norman, you mustn’t
stimulate Rudolph. You two are to be good friends,
and will have plenty of time to talk bye and bye.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone gave her one of his speaking glances,
then as master was breaking again into animated
speech, he said, briefly, “You’re done out. Rest for
a bit. I’m going to get you a drop of stimulant,” and
he with his wife vanished from the room.</p>

<p>Left alone with me, for Gringo and Walter Scott
with exquisite dog propriety had followed their owners,
master gave me the whole story.</p>

<p>“Come up, Boy,” he said patting his knees, and I
jumped up.</p>

<p>It seems he had rushed to a train in the morning,
reached the country place where the hospital is situated,
and driven rapidly there.</p>

<p>A smiling nurse had led him to a room where there
were ever so many baby cots all tagged and numbered.
She showed him one lovely, weeny child tagged Granton.
Master nearly went crazy. He couldn’t, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wouldn’t, believe at first that it was his, and the head
physician explained, that after consultation with master’s
own physician in New York, they had decided to
gratify Mrs. Granton, who had wished to surprise her
husband, and not let him know that a baby was coming
to her. It was unusual, the doctor said, but it had to
be done, as they feared for her reason, if they deceived
her.</p>

<p>“Take me to her, take me to her,” said my master.
“I forgive the deception. The mother of my child
can do no wrong.”</p>

<p>At first he had great trouble. She longed to see
him, yet did not want to. There was a great change
in her appearance. Finally, after sending message
after message, he prevailed upon her to let him pay
a five-minute call.</p>

<p>He did not tell me everything just here, but I knew
by what he did say, that dear mistress had lost all her
pretty looks, and yet now she was more attractive than
ever in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s the soul shining through, Boy, that counts,”
he said with tears in his eyes. “She is a madonna
now.”</p>

<p>When was the baby coming home, that is what I
wanted to know, but I did not find out till the Bonstones
came back in the room.</p>

<p>Mistress and young master were to return home
in three weeks.</p>

<p>“And the baby’s name?” asked Mrs. Bonstone, when
master was taking his soup and looking much refreshed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Master dropped his spoon. “There’s only one name
in this country good enough for my boy,” he said intensely.</p>

<p>“Oh! George Washington, of course,” she replied.
“I might have known.”</p>

<p>After master took his soup and crackers, or “biscuits,”
as Walter Scott calls them, he simply collapsed
with fatigue. He couldn’t wait for supper.</p>

<p>You see he had been up all the night before in the
cathedral, but he did not tell them this. Even with
one’s best friends, I notice, human beings have reticences.</p>

<p>“I tell you everything, Boy,” said master to me
afterward, “for you can’t repeat. If dogs could talk,
they would not be such valuable friends to us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone was just going to take master upstairs,
and put him to bed, when to the amazement of
the men, Mrs. Bonstone began to cry.</p>

<p>“Stanna,” said her husband in a frightened way.</p>

<p>“I want a baby,” she said in a choked voice.</p>

<p>They stared at her, and so did we three dogs.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if you wait,” said master kindly.</p>

<p>“I want one to-night,” she said mopping her eyes.
“There are so many poor little babies without a home&mdash;unhappy
little creatures, crying in the night. I want
to adopt one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone, as if he were telling her he would
go down town and buy her a present, said, “Wait till
I come downstairs. I’ll get you one.”</p>

<p>She threw herself in a big chair, and cried harder
than ever. I think she was overwrought, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
having a spell of nerves. I followed my master and
Mr. Bonstone upstairs.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bonstone,” said my master, “it isn’t so
easy to pick up a baby at a minute’s notice. You’d
better put her off till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“She’s got to have it to-night,” said he, pressing
his thin lips together in his inflexible way.</p>

<p>“There are all kinds of difficulties,” continued my
master, “signing contracts, proving life support and
legacy after your death, giving references and so on.”</p>

<p>“There are babies ready to jump into a home,”
said Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“I have it,” exclaimed master as he sat on the edge
of the bed, in a magnificent guest room. “Go to old
Ellen, I’ll give you her address, and take my dog.
He’ll lead you to her apartment.”</p>

<p>This just suited me. I hadn’t been out all day, except
for my little walk before dinner, and I jumped
and fawned round Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” he inquired in his short way.</p>

<p>Master explained how much he thought of her, and
even wrote her a note, introducing Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“Does she know?” inquired Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“About the baby?” said my master with a heavenly
smile. “She was the first one to get a telegram.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone didn’t understand this, but I did. Old
Ellen would be in the seventh heaven, and Robert Lee
and Beanie would be half way there.</p>

<p>I danced downstairs, and danced up to Mrs. Bonstone,
and she let her handkerchief fall on the floor like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a little damp cobweb. Then she sniffed, and asked
her husband to lend her his.</p>

<p>He took out his big one for her, then he telephoned
for a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>“If you let the baby get cold, I’ll never forgive you,”
said Mrs. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“It won’t get cold,” he said, and seizing her satin,
fur-trimmed cloak, he doubled it all up, and put it
under his arm.</p>

<p>Gringo wanted to come too, but Mr. Bonstone said,
“Go back, your face might frighten it.”</p>

<p>Gringo wasn’t very well pleased, though he saw the
wisdom of this remark. I often had long arguments
with him about the bulldog visage. I claimed that
bulldogs, Boston terriers, any dogs with lay-back noses
and undershot jaws, were displeasing and terrifying
to timid human beings. Give me a dog with a good
facial expression, and a head not running all to jaws.
Of course, I loved Gringo because he was my friend,
but I would rather have had him a long-headed, amiable-looking
fellow, if I’d been making him.</p>

<p>I scampered down the steps and out-of-doors like
the wind, and was waiting by the taxi when Mr. Bonstone
came. One would have thought that his wife
would have accompanied him on so important a quest,
but strange to say she did not seem to want to come,
and Gringo, who heard her talking to herself after
we left, said that her staying behind was a bit of feminine
mother-wit. She wanted a little poor child to
make it happy. There was no doubt of her loving it,
but she wasn’t so sure of her husband. If he chose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it, he would be more interested, and if at any time
he found fault with the child, she could say, “Why,
it was your choice.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take us very long to get to old Ellen’s
avenue, which was quite bright and lively, but her flat
was dark and quiet, when we mounted the long stairs.
She had evidently gone to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone had a hard time to find the bell, for,
as he was not a smoker, he did not carry matches.
After a long time of ringing, Robert Lee appeared and
asked drowsily what was wanted.</p>

<p>As Mr. Bonstone spoke to him, he flashed me a
glance of recognition, then went to his mother’s bed-room,
where Beanie was barking lustily.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone and I entered, and he sat in Ellen’s
rocker while I ran to greet Beanie, and talk over the
joyful news with him. The dog was, as I thought he
would be, wild with delight.</p>

<p>“I want to see it&mdash;I want to see it,” he said over
and over, and I promised that by hook or by crook,
I would manage so that he might see this little baby
of his dearly loved mistress.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d be jealous,” I said. “Mistress
will never want you home again, if she has a
baby to play with.”</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful, but he said bravely, “I can’t
help that. The main thing is to have her happy.”</p>

<p>“Beanie,” I said, “you are a much better dog than
I thought you were, when I first knew you.”</p>

<p>“I guess troubles improve one,” he said, “and I
feel better since I lost my flesh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too much fat is bad for dog or man,” I said, then
I ran to old Ellen who was coming in dressed in her
neat cotton wrapper, and looking as calm as if she
was used to being routed out of her bed every night
of her life.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone explained his errand, and her face
lighted up. “If you’se a friend of my dear Mister
Granton,” she said, “old Ellen will do anything she can
for you.” Then she wrinkled her brow. She was
doing some thinking.</p>

<p>“Would your lady take a little dark child?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Do you mean a coloured child?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” and she smiled; “no, no&mdash;I mean
dark like Sicilian or Syrian. I know a Syrian baby&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good healthy child?” asked Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;a monstrous fine child, and not so very
dark complected&mdash;but considerable darker than you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go telephone,” said Mr. Bonstone, with what
for him, was quite an amount of eagerness.</p>

<p>He got out of the room so quickly, that I could not
follow him. In a few minutes he came back smiling.
“My wife says she doesn’t care what the shade is&mdash;to
bring it quickly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go first, sir,” said Ellen, “it’s close by,” and
she stepped out into the hall, and crossing to a near by
flat, knocked on a door and went in.</p>

<p>After some time she came back, and asked Mr. Bonstone
to follow her. I pushed after him, for this was
wildly interesting to me. I took good care, though, to
keep in the background, lest I should be driven out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>This other flat reminded me of the nests of boxes
ladies buy&mdash;one box inside another, and another inside
that, till you get to the tiniest box. It seems a
Syrian family renting it, took boarders, and at first it
was quite an effort to single out the various members
of the various families.</p>

<p>They all looked respectable and fairly clean, but
they were certainly very crowded. I think they were
all peddlers of fruit and vegetables or trinkets. There
was a roaring coal fire in a kitchen stove, and they all
sat round it. One man was playing on a queer-looking
musical instrument, and the others were listening to
him. One big girl had a baby in her arms. This probably
was the baby Ellen had spoken of, and I looked
at it anxiously.</p>

<p>It was a healthy, happy-looking little object in a
ragged, but not too dirty frock.</p>

<p>Ellen motioned to this girl, and she followed us
into an inner room, or rather a closet, where a young
woman with a dark, eager face lay on a tiny bed. It
was a poor place, and smelt stuffy, but not unclean.</p>

<p>I knew by the girl’s face she was the baby’s mother.
Oh! what a devouring glance she gave Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>He said never a word, but opening his coat, took a
picture from his pocket and laid it before her. That
was Mrs. Bonstone, I knew. I could imagine how
the picture of this pretty, rich young woman impressed
this sick, poor young woman.</p>

<p>The young woman’s eye just burnt into the photograph.
That probably was what she would like to be,
and here she was laid up with an injured back, Ellen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
told us, suffering untold torture most of the time, and
likely to die any hour.</p>

<p>She was not related to the other persons in the
house. She was merely boarding with them. Her
young husband had died while on the way to this
country, and she had been struck by a trolley car a few
days before, and knew she must die and leave her baby.</p>

<p>Her anxiety was frightful, yet there was a kind of
comfort in it for her, for she gazed from Ellen, whom
she knew, to Mr. Bonstone whom she did not know,
as if to say, “You are all right, if she recommends
you.”</p>

<p>“Ask her if she has any relatives here or in her
own country,” said Mr. Bonstone to Ellen.</p>

<p>Ellen, making use of a lingo I did not understand,
put the question to her.</p>

<p>The woman made vehement gestures, “No, no, the
baby is free.”</p>

<p>“Her father was well off,” said old Ellen in a low
voice. “He had cattle and sheep, but he was cruel. He
beat her, when she said she would not marry a rich,
old man. She hated them both, and ran away with a
poor young man who helped with her father’s flocks.
Then he died.”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you this?” asked Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“No, sir, the other Syrians. She asked them to take
her baby after she died, not to let the old grandfather
know. He likely would not have it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But these people are poor,” said Mr. Bonstone,
“and that room seems half full of children.”</p>

<p>“They are very good to each other,” said Ellen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
simply, “but they would be very glad to get rid of it.
She wants you to have it, too. See her face.”</p>

<p>The poor young woman, brushing back her long,
thick, black hair from her clammy-looking forehead,
motioned to the girl to give her the baby.</p>

<p>She could not hold it properly, on account of the
pain in her back. Her groans were dreadful, but she
steadied herself, and pulled a cross out of the breast
of her gown&mdash;the poor creature had no nice white
nightie like rich ladies. She was in bed with her street
dress on.</p>

<p>She wanted Mr. Bonstone to swear on the crucifix
that he would be good to her child.</p>

<p>The scene was pitiful, and Mr. Bonstone, strong
man as he was, almost broke down. Tears rolled
down his cheeks, and he bit his lip painfully. He took
the cross in his hands&mdash;he promised solemnly to provide
for the child, and if he could not keep it himself,
to find a good home for it.</p>

<p>The poor creature could not understand a word
he said, but she knew just as well what he was saying,
as if she had been born in America. Her child was
safe, and something told me that her mother-soul was
deeply gratified that a person evidently rich and of
good position would stand between the cold world and
her little, helpless, brown baby.</p>

<p>She took the baby on one arm, and began to kiss and
caress it for the last time, for Ellen had told her that
the gentleman wished to take it away. Her moans of
pain, and her broken exclamations of mother-love were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
too heart-rending. I could not stand it, and ran out
into the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone came out presently with the baby in
his arms. “This is awful,” he said to Ellen. “Why
did they not send her to the hospital?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand these people, sir. They don’t
know what hospitals are. If they do, they are frightened
of them. She begged to stay with her child. She
has had good attention, sir. You see she wasn’t
brought up like you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone’s lip drooped. Ellen didn’t know
what an adventurous, strange career he had had.</p>

<p>How carefully he went down the steps with the
baby, after he had thanked Ellen for her interest, and
had slipped something into her hand. He held it
quite nicely to him all the way home. I think he
liked it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone must have been listening for the taxi,
for she met us in the doorway.</p>

<p>She never said a word, just held out her arms. Her
husband put the baby in them, and she ran to the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>There she was, unwrapping it when Mr. Bonstone
came in.</p>

<p>“Oh, Norman, Norman, Norman,” she said over
and over again, “what a dear little brown baby!”</p>

<p>She kissed it, and squeezed it, and asked how old
it was, and where he had got it.</p>

<p>He said it was a year old.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said profoundly, “then I am twelve
months ahead of Clossie. Isn’t it a darling,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
went on, “such liquid eyes, and such lovely hair, and
it isn’t a bit frightened.”</p>

<p>“It’s been used to living in a crowd,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>“But its clothes,” she said, “they’re old, and faded,
and just a little smelly. Norman, we shall dress her
like a princess&mdash;what’s her name?”</p>

<p>Alas! he had forgotten to inquire.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” she said consolingly. “It
doesn’t matter. I’d like to name her myself. You
say she’s Syrian. She shall be Cyria, spelt with a ‘C’
instead of an ‘S’&mdash;C-y-r-i-a&mdash;isn’t that pretty?”</p>

<p>He acknowledged that it was.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me all about the mother,” she said, “but
first drag that little rocking-chair near the fire, so I
can rock her.”</p>

<p>It was hard for Mr. Bonstone to describe the intensely
painful scene with the mother, but he did so
manfully.</p>

<p>“Norman,” she screamed, “you didn’t take this baby
from a dying woman!”</p>

<p>“You said you wanted it to-night,” he replied bluntly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that like a man,” she said tragically. “Take
it back,” and she held it out to him.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” he replied. “I offered to
leave it. The mother kissed your face in the photograph,
and refused to have me keep the baby from you.
I think she was afraid something might happen after
she died to prevent your getting it.”</p>

<p>“I shall go right to her,” said Mrs. Bonstone. “Call
another taxi.”</p>

<p>The dear, patient man got another taxi, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
him, Mrs. Bonstone flew off to the mother. I did not
go this time, but I heard her telling my master the
next morning all about it.</p>

<p>It seems the Syrian mother was frightfully ill when
they got there. Mrs. Bonstone stayed with her, and
sent her husband to get a nurse for the mother, and
one for the baby. He spent a part of the night in
this agreeable pursuit, and by breakfast time the Bonstones,
nurse and baby were comfortably settled on
Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>Money does certainly oil the wheels of life. How
long it would have taken a person on foot to accomplish
what the Bonstones did that night! I could not
help thinking of some further lines the English greyhound
taught me&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“As I sat in my café, I said to myself,</div>
<div class="indentbase">They may talk as they please about what they call pelf.</div>
<div class="indentbase">But help it, I can not, I can not help thinking,</div>
<div class="indentbase">How pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!</div>
<div class="indentbase">How pleasant it is to have money!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A little while before lunch, Mrs. Bonstone called us
dogs to go to the nursery with her. It was a room
that had been quickly fitted up for the brown baby.
What a transformation in the little creature! Some
one had been up bright and early, shopping for Miss
Cyria. She looked a little aristocrat in lace and muslin,
and how deliciously she smelt&mdash;just like a faint lily
of the valley. What an up-bringing that child would
have!</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone, or that good little Wasp, as Gringo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
called her now, paid two long visits every day to the
baby’s mother as long as the poor thing lived.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mr. Bonstone went with her. As I have
said before, the man was no talker, but I heard him
one day in the smoking-room, which both men haunted,
though neither smoked. (I have forgotten to say that
we had been invited to spend a week at the Bonstones,
and the two men got to be great friends.) Well, this
day Mr. Bonstone was telling my master of the Syrian
woman’s actions when her beautiful child was brought
in to her tiny room that first night.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything like it,” he said, “that poor
wretch racked by pain. She draws herself up&mdash;stares
at that old Ellen, at the child&mdash;at my wife’s picture&mdash;then
she gets out that cross. ’Pon my word I nearly
broke down&mdash;she’s a living martyr, but the awful joy
of her face. I say, Granton&mdash;there’s something about
mothers, men can’t comprehend.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like it,” my master said softly,
then he went on to tell about his wife and his baby.</p>

<p>“Queer, isn’t it, more of the well-to-do don’t adopt
these youngsters,” said Mr. Bonstone. “Cyria is going
to be a beauty.”</p>

<p>“You’ll bring her up as your own child, I suppose,”
said master.</p>

<p>“I guess so&mdash;after that mother.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of heredity?” said master.</p>

<p>“Fudge, no&mdash;it’s up to us to shape her.”</p>

<p>“Frightens one, doesn’t it,” said master.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone smiled one of his rare, peculiar
smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and leads you on, too, like a beacon. If
Stanna and I have no children, that child may be the
light of our old age.”</p>

<p>At that moment, she came in the room with the
brown baby in her arms.</p>

<p>“I just wanted you to see her this morning, Norman,”
she said, “she’s so unusually sweet.”</p>

<p>Her adopted father chuckled to her, and clucked
quite like a real one.</p>

<p>Master examined her with the eye of a connoisseur,
then as he could never help dragging in his own young
one, he said, “She seems like a giantess compared to
my small son.”</p>

<p>“Just look at her dimples, Norman,” continued Mrs.
Bonstone. “Aren’t they fetching this morning, and
that cute little way her hair curls round her forehead?
Seems to me, it’s more curly than usual.”</p>

<p>“And her lovely dark skin,” said Mr. Bonstone
grimly. “Say, Stanna&mdash;you’re not planning any nonsense
about keeping the knowledge of her people from
her?”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I would ever allow a child of
mine to be ashamed of its origin?” said Mrs. Bonstone.
“I have taken her several times to see those
good creatures who were willing to adopt her. They
are not a bit envious, and finger her pretty clothes
with the utmost satisfaction. It reminds me of the
first day her poor mother saw her dressed up. Oh!
Norman, if you could have seen her face. Cyria
did look like an angel in her white silk cloak and
bonnet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said her husband, then he nudged
master to listen to the song his wife had begun to
sing.</p>

<p>She had dropped into her little rocker that she
kept in the smoking-room among the men’s big chairs,
and she was going over something of her own composition
in a low voice, holding the baby’s face against
her own as she sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“I never had a baby, but I know a little song,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And I sing it to my baby that does to me belong,</div>
<div class="indentbase">She’s the sweetest little baby that ever I did see,</div>
<div class="indentbase">The brownest, sweetest baby and she’s all the world to me!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now, I didn’t think this was so very clever, and
I don’t think master did, but Mr. Bonstone was so
enraptured that he paid a young man a handsome
sum to round out this song about the brown baby and
set it to music, and strange to say, the simple words
and the air became so popular that I even heard boys
whistling it in the streets of New York.</p>

<p>After a time, the poor mother died, and was buried
at Mr. Bonstone’s expense.</p>

<p>“My! my! what a funeral they gave her,” said old
Ellen. “If ever the Bonstones want anything from
the Syrians on this avenue, all they’ve got to do is to
say it.”</p>

<p>I was greatly excited about our own baby, and oh!
how I longed to see it, but my turn did not come for
several weeks.</p>

<p>Master used to motor out every afternoon to see
how mother and child were getting on, but I was always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
left in the car, till one day, when I squealed
wildly for permission to go in, master took me into
the big hospital, and a nurse wiped me all over with
a damp cloth which had something on it that smelled
queer. I think she was afraid of germs.</p>

<p>When I was ushered into the sunny, lovely room
where sat my mistress, I felt all broken up. She was
as thin as a scarecrow, and just about as good-looking.</p>

<p>“See, Rudolph,” cried the poor thing, “even the dog
scarcely knows me.”</p>

<p>After that, there was nothing to do but to run up to
her, wag my tail, twist my body, and pretend that I
was charmed to see her. Perhaps I should not say
pretend. I really, by this time, had gotten to be so
sorry for my poor mistress, that I pitied her&mdash;and
when a dog pities any one, it is only a step to love.
Then I was sincerely and truly delighted about the
baby, because it had made my master happy, quite
happy. Of course, I should be jealous of it, but
truly, when master held it down for me to look at it,
and I saw how gentle, and harmless and helpless it
was, with nothing but those two balled-up fists to defend
itself against the big, powerful world, something
swelled up inside me, and I vowed a good dog vow,
that if any other dog started to molest that little
lump of flesh, I’d tear him limb from limb.</p>

<p>I licked its little dress, and the nurse ran to get a
dish with some solution in it to wash the place I’d
touched. Really, these nurses and doctors carry things
too far with their germ theories. Why wasn’t master
just as likely to have germs as I. We had both come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through the same parts of the city. Besides, I’m as
clean as a whistle. Every day Louis brushes me, and
cleans my ears, and occasionally I have a bath. Not
too often, for it is not natural for dogs to be kept
in soak. Well&mdash;to come back to the day of my first
visit to the baby. Master was so pleased to think I
liked the baby, that I got an extra share of petting on
the way home.</p>

<p>We were alone in the car, and I was sitting close
up beside him. As we were passing through Mount
Vernon I began to think of <a href="#Fig_148">the Lady Gay cat</a>. That
cat had been on my mind for a long time, and one
evening I had scampered down to her eating-house on
Sixth Avenue to see how she was getting along.</p>

<p>She was not there. She had left some time ago,
another cat told me, after I had persuaded him to
stand long enough for me to question him. I wondered
what had become of her. Had she found her
way back to this pretty place to her own good mistress,
or was she dead or perhaps stolen again?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE LADY GAY CAT</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Just here something extraordinary happened, and
I must say in connection with it, that I have
marvellous luck in remeeting persons and animals.</p>

<p>My master suddenly exclaimed, “I am frightfully
thirsty, Boy. Let us stop at this nice little cottage,
and see if that old lady in the window will give me
a drink.”</p>

<p>Master drew up the car by the side of the road, got
out, and I jumped after him, and whom do you think
I saw rolling on a bed of cat-nip under the kitchen
window&mdash;my acquaintance of a night some time ago&mdash;the
Lady Gay cat.</p>

<p>She knew me at once, and with a surprised purr
sprang toward me. “How do you do, dog, I am glad
to see you. I believe you saved my life by getting
me to stop stuffing myself. It was my only pleasure
in that dreadful place, and it cost some effort to give
it up.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me about yourself,” I begged her, “and
hurry up. Master won’t wait long, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>She smiled the smile of superior knowledge. “Yes,
he will, when Granny gets talking to him. She’s the
most crackajack old woman you ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Her face looked fine,” I said, “as I saw it through
the window.”</p>

<p>“Ah! she’s the woman for me,” said the cat fervently,
“but you want to know how I got back to
her. Just after that evening I saw you, things began
to go badly at the eating-place. The help broke the
dishes, and got saucy, the people off the street didn’t
patronise us, the man broke his leg, and the woman
got melancholy. One day when she sat staring at
the floor, I happened to pass in front of her.</p>

<p>“‘I believe it’s that black cat,’ she said, springing
up and running to the room where her husband lay
in bed. ‘We’ve had bad luck ever since we picked
her up.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t be a fool,’ he said roughly.</p>

<p>“But he couldn’t stop her. ‘It’s true,’ she said,
‘I’ve heard bad luck always follows stolen animals,
and your luck don’t change till you take ’em back.’</p>

<p>“The man was quite angry, but he couldn’t change
her. Didn’t she, the next Sunday, in spite of their
lack of money, take the train and bring me out here.</p>

<p>“She brought the basket in which she had confined
me right in here to Granny. ‘Look here,’ she said
(she is a great, fat woman and very outspoken), ‘I
did an awful thing a few weeks ago. I stole the cat
I saw sitting near this house. I don’t know whether
it’s yours or not, but I want you to help me get it
back to its rightful owner. I believe it brought a
kind of spell on me.’</p>

<p>“Granny opened the basket, and oh! how gently
she took me out and stroked my fur. ‘It’s my cat,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
she said, ‘and I thank you for bringing her back. Sit
down, and I’ll make you a cup of tea.’</p>

<p>“The woman was very glad to sit down, and have
some tea and talk, after her ride in the train, and
while I licked my fur into shape, I listened to what
my dear old Granny said to her. Now, I want to tell
you this, just to convince you what a good mistress
I had, for you seemed to think I was a little soft to
mourn so much.</p>

<p>“Said Granny, ‘Why did you steal my cat?’</p>

<p>“‘To hunt mice,’ said the woman. ‘An eating-house
always draws them.’</p>

<p>“‘But, you could have got one in the city. Why
take my little friend, who loves the country?’</p>

<p>“‘City cats ain’t no good,’ said the woman.
‘They’re all sick, except the rich cats that have a nice
place to play.’</p>

<p>“‘Stealing is always wrong,’ said Granny.</p>

<p>“‘You bet it is,’ said the woman. ‘I ain’t goin’ to
steal nothin’ again. I was brought up right. I had
a good mother.’</p>

<p>“‘How is your business getting on?’ then asked
Granny, for she likes to know all about any one she
sees.</p>

<p>“‘Rank,’ said the woman, ‘the place needs a new
fit-out, and the landlord won’t do it.’</p>

<p>“‘By fit-out, what do you mean?’ asked Granny.</p>

<p>“‘I mean new paper, new linoleum, some mirrors&mdash;folks
love to stare at themselves, and I want a little
closet fitted up with a looking-glass and a wash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
basin, so the shop-girls can fix their hair, and powder
their faces when they comes in to eat.’</p>

<p>“‘How much would it cost?’ asked Granny.</p>

<p>“‘Two hundred dollars at the least,’ said the woman
in a dreary way. ‘It’s a big place.’</p>

<p>“Granny went to her grandmother’s soup-tureen
in the closet, and took out her stocking. She has a
stocking, you know, but you must not tell any one.
She doesn’t believe much in banks.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t going to give the woman money, was
she?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” said the cat, who spoke quite
slowly and mouthed her words, as if she did not often
have a listener.</p>

<p>I find that longing to talk with cats and dogs and
human beings too. So many are ready to talk&mdash;so few
want to listen.</p>

<p>Well, the black cat went on to tell me that the
woman looked as amazed as if she had seen a ghost,
when good old Granny began counting out the five
dollar bills.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t mean to say you’re going to lend me
the money,’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“‘Just what I’m going to do,’ said Granny. ‘I’ve
two good sons. I brought ’em up right, and they
slip me in a five-dollar bill every time they write. I’m
going to lend you what I’ve got.’</p>

<p>“‘You’re going to lend me money,’ cried the
woman, ‘when I stole your cat?’</p>

<p>“‘You’re going to be a better woman in the future,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
than you have been in the past,’ said Granny. ‘I can
see it in your eye.’</p>

<p>“Then the woman broke down and cried, but recovered
herself when Granny began to count the
money. They went over it together, and made out one
hundred and ninety-five dollars.</p>

<p>“‘Take it,’ said Granny, holding out the stocking,
‘and bring it back when you get good and ready.
There’s no hurry.’</p>

<p>“The woman held tight on the stocking, but she said
quite anxiously, ‘How much interest will you charge?’</p>

<p>“‘No interest,’ said Granny.</p>

<p>“This broke the fat woman all up. She cried and
sobbed, and when she found in addition that Granny
didn’t want even an I. O. U., she hugged and kissed
her, as if she had been her daughter. She told Granny
all that had ever happened to her, and they became
great friends on the spot.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” I said to the cat, “I see master drawing
on his gloves.”</p>

<p>We had moved into the cute little hallway of the
cottage, and I could look in through the kitchen door
and see master talking to the old lady who had made
him a cup of tea just as she had done for the fat
woman. I think he was telling her about the baby,
for she had a photograph album on the table between
them, and had been pointing out pictures of little children
to him.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine story,” I said&mdash;“what’s the end?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any end,” said the black cat triumphantly.
“It’s still going on. The woman comes out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
here every Sunday evening when trade is low, and she
brings goodies to Granny, and Granny goes in to see
her once a week, and goes to a show with her, and tells
me all about it when she comes home.”</p>

<p>“And the restaurant,” I said, “did they make it
over?”</p>

<p>“Granny says it’s a dream now, with bright yellow
and red and purple flowers on the wall, and a fine
mirror, and lots of water and towels, and there’s a big
crowd all the time.”</p>

<p>“And the money?” I went on.</p>

<p>“Granny’s getting it all back&mdash;ten dollars a week,
and the woman loves her like a daughter. Granny
never had a girl, just boys.”</p>

<p>I pushed my inquiries a little further, “And how
does the woman treat you?”</p>

<p>“Like a Christian. She says, ‘No one need ever say
nothin’ agin’ black cats to me. There’s more in animals
than most folks reckon.’”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” I said running after my master who
had shaken hands with the old woman, and was jumping
into the machine. “That’s a fine story. I’m
mighty glad you had a safe exit from your troubles.”</p>

<p>“Call again,” said the cat to me, and “Call again,”
called Granny to master, as we sped away.</p>

<p>The next interesting thing that happened to me was
the home-coming of the baby. My! my! what a fuss&mdash;the
apartment refurnished, renovated, fumigated,
aired and reaired. Master, whistling as cheerfully
as a school-boy, gave up his lovely front room and
bath to his little pickaninny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“You and I won’t mind the view of the backs of
apartment-houses, will we, Boy?” he said to me.</p>

<p>Of course I didn’t mind. Anything to make him
happy, and to keep with him. I was mortally afraid
he would get like those silly nurses, and send me out
of the house.</p>

<p>At last, the great day came, and master and I took
the car out to the hospital. Mistress all wrapped up
and veiled, and baby and nurse got into it, and we
tooted back to the city.</p>

<p>Master had warned the maids that mistress had got
very thin and nervous, and they must be extra gentle
and quiet in their manner with her. They were lovely
to her face, but they almost cried in the kitchen over
her changed looks.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear,” whimpered cook, “ain’t she the holy
fright&mdash;the darlin’ thing,” and Annie said something
even worse. However, from that day on, they never
criticised her as sharply as they had before. The
baby had brought a new spirit into the house.</p>

<p>My dear master still thought his wife was beautiful,
and I could see that he was perfectly terrified,
lest she should eat too many sweets and get fat again.
He offered her a diamond necklace, if she would stop
eating chocolates, and he watched her at the table,
and coaxed her not to touch any puddings that had
a rich sauce.</p>

<p>One day, he found a little bit of brown paste on
her upper lip. “Dearest,” he said anxiously, “have
you been eating chocolates?”</p>

<p>She blushed like a naughty child. “Just one,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
said; “nurse had some. But I won’t do it again,” she
went on shaking her head, “I’m really anxious to
please you, Rudolph.”</p>

<p>He kissed her quite warmly for him, and pushing
the table away, sat down quite close beside her, and
began to read.</p>

<p>I was delighted that she liked to have him read to
her now, but it made a great difference to me. She
used to watch the clock with cunning eyes, and get
more and more interested in what he was reading, the
later the evening grew. Sometimes, she asked a question
which did not exactly fit in, for example when
he was declaiming about the war in Poland, and she
said, “I always did dislike Spaniards.”</p>

<p>He laid down his book. “I said nothing about Spaniards,
my dear.”</p>

<p>Her thoughts had been wandering, and she couldn’t
speak till he gave her a clue. “I was reading of the
woes of the Poles.”</p>

<p>“That is what I meant,” she said, “Poles of course,
I never did care for them.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had ever met any,” he said
dreamily, then he plunged again into his book.</p>

<p>She was nearly dead with sleep that night, and soon
she said, “Rudolph, would you just read me something
about children, before I go to bed?”</p>

<p>He put down the war-book, and took up one of
poetry. I was sleepy too, but I caught a phrase, “The
cry of the children,” and later in the night, this phrase
came back to me.</p>

<p>We had no walk&mdash;it was too late to go when mistress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
went to the baby, and master said to me, “Let us
turn in too, Boy-Dog.”</p>

<p>It was good we got a little sleep early in the night,
for we had rather a disturbed time later.</p>

<p>While master was undressing, he talked to me about
children. “Poor little wretches,” he said. “How much
they have to cry about. So many troubles that they
outgrow with age.”</p>

<p>I listened to him with interest. I used not to know
much about children, for I had never been thrown
much with them, my owners being mostly childless or
unmarried persons. However, as I told Gringo when
I first met him, I had a great respect for the very
young of the human kind, and I thought them remarkably
clever.</p>

<p>Since the baby came, I had been observing him
closely. His little face looked to me very wise, and
sometimes his expression was almost painful, as if he
were trying to tell us something of a wonderful place
he had come from. But the poor little soul had no
words to express his thoughts. He just waved his
little fists, and rolled his head in despair.</p>

<p>Master had gone quite daffy on the subject of babies.
Dating from the day that he had heard of the arrival
of the baby, he stared at every child he met in the
street. He gave pennies to poor children, and watched
them with delight when they ran to a candy shop. He
stopped the perambulators of rich babies, and begged
permission of the nurses to look at them. All babies
were dear to him, because he had one of his own.</p>

<p>To come back to this night, I slept for a while, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I woke up with a feeling of great distress. Some one
was in trouble near me. I could hear nothing, smell
nothing, but I knew it was so, and I sprang uneasily
from the big chair where I slept, and went to my master’s
bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">HIS MOTHER’S BOY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">He was sleeping like a boy. I hated to disturb
him, and I ran to the door leading to the hall,
and smelt hard under it. Nothing there&mdash;I went back
to bed, but my uneasiness increased so terribly, that,
at last, if I had not aroused my master, I should have
burst into terrible howling which would have disturbed
the household and waked the baby.</p>

<p>I pulled hard at the sleeve of his pajamas. “Master,
master, wake up.”</p>

<p>He turned on me eyes unseeing at first, then intelligent.
“What’s the matter, Boy-Dog&mdash;burglars?”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what was the matter, so I pulled hard
to show he was to come and investigate.</p>

<p>He rolled quickly out of bed, snatched his bath-robe
and followed me. He knew that I would not rouse
him for a trifle.</p>

<p>We stole out into the hall like two cats. There I
was puzzled. Which way did the uneasiness lead me?
Master, of course, went right toward the door of the
precious baby’s room, but I turned my back on it, and
led him to the door leading out of the apartment into
the general hall.</p>

<p>Master, with a greatly relieved face, softly unlocked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
it, and we stood together outside. There were several
other apartments on this floor&mdash;the trouble was in one
of them.</p>

<p>Ah! at last I caught it, the faint sound of sobbing.
I rushed to the door of a pretty delicate little English
woman whose husband had gone to the war. I laid my
ear to the crack underneath&mdash;yes, it was there, the
sound of a child crying in the night.</p>

<p>I scratched, and whined, and looked up at master.
He listened and heard nothing, but he had such confidence
in my judgment, that he pressed the electric
button.</p>

<p>No reply, and the sobbing stopped suddenly. The
trouble was still there, however, and I redoubled my
scratching at the door.</p>

<p>Master rang again, then tried the door softly.</p>

<p>Finally he called in a low voice, “Mrs. Waverlee!”</p>

<p>She did not reply, then he said, “Egbert, Egbert, are
you awake? It is Mr. Granton.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. I thought it was pretty
good in master to stand there so patiently. He could
hear nothing, see nothing, but he relied on me.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise inside, like a chair falling
over. A little voice cried, “Oh!” then a trembling
hand began to fuss with the lock of the door, and at
last it was thrown silently open.</p>

<p>We stepped inside. Confronting us was young
Egbert Waverlee in his little nightie, his face swollen
and disfigured from much weeping. He was trembling
with the cold, for all the windows were open.</p>

<p>He held out his little hand. “Mr. Granton, I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
wake muvver,” he said with quivering lip, “and she’s
getting cold.”</p>

<p>He was a dear little lad, and often came to call with
his mother on my mistress, but lately we had not seen
much of them. I knew that her husband had gone to
England, and she was feeling very sad about it.</p>

<p>My master strode quickly past the child to his mother’s
room. She was not in bed, she lay all in a heap
on the floor, beneath a large picture of her husband.</p>

<p>As my master lifted her in his strong arms, and laid
her on her bed, a pencil fell from her cold fingers to
the floor. He saw it, also a piece of notepaper with
a crest on it, and presently he picked them both up and
put them in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then he ran his hand rapidly over Mrs. Waverlee’s
face, put it on her heart, and turned gravely to small
Egbert: “How long has your mother been asleep,
my boy?”</p>

<p>The little fellow ran to a table, and picked up a telegram.
“I think this made muvver sleepy. She read
it, then she walked about and acted like a naughty boy,
for she scribbled on the walls with a pencil, then she
kissed me, and lay down there and went to sleep. Please
wake her up, Mr. Granton.”</p>

<p>Master read the telegram, put it in his pocket, then
he said, “Come, boy, let us telephone for the doctor.”</p>

<p>“And leave muvver all alone?” said the child.</p>

<p>“She won’t wake, my boy,” said master hoarsely.
“She is sleeping a sound sleep.”</p>

<p>“Come, then, let us telephone quick,” said the child.
He seized master’s hand, pulled him from the room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and stood trembling with excitement while master
called up his family physician.</p>

<p>“Will you come in my bed, and get warm till he
comes?” asked master of the child.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” said the little boy in an agony, “not
while muvver is so cold. Come, now, let us do something
to make her warm.”</p>

<p>Master didn’t know what to do. He cast an appealing
look at his wife’s door. Oh! if he could only ask
her to help him. He didn’t quite like to disturb her.
Finally he sighed, and allowed the boy to drag him
to the bed-room.</p>

<p>The little fellow ran to the bath-room. His face
was more cheerful, now that he was doing something.
He let the hot water run, and to my master’s astonishment,
seized a rubber bag and filled it.</p>

<p>“Often and often I’ve done this for muvver after
Sarah went away,” he said with a pitiful smile.</p>

<p>While staring at him, it came to my mind that I had
heard some servants’ gossip about Mrs. Waverlee
turning economical, so she could send money home for
the war. Instead of keeping two maids, she had one
only, who came in the morning, and went away at night.</p>

<p>The child was wagging his dark head at my master
in a confidential fashion. “Muvver’s not very strong,
you know. Father said when he went away, ‘Take good
care of her, boysie, till I come back.’”</p>

<p>Master groaned so pitifully, that I knew the telegram
had said that the child’s father had been killed
in a battle.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Granton,” said the little boy, “please<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
heap your hannies with boysie’s bed-clothes, while I
slip this in by muvver’s poor cold feet.”</p>

<p>The unhappy man did as he was told, and together
they covered the poor lady warmly, and then Mr.
Granton said gravely, “Your mother would not like it,
if she saw you standing here shivering with the cold.”</p>

<p>“No, she wouldn’t,” said the boy smiling bravely.
“She’d say, ‘Boysie, you are going to have another
sore throat.’ Mr. Granton, boysie will get in beside
muvver. She always puts her arm round me, and
makes me so comfy.”</p>

<p>I am only a dog, but my heart ached for that child.
His little manner was sweet and coaxing, his cunning
eyes were fixed on his grown-up friend. He knew what
had happened, but he wouldn’t let his little self believe
it. He was putting up the bravest fight I ever saw
any one put up, and the man didn’t know what to do
with him.</p>

<p>Finally master got desperate. He had closed the
windows, and turned on the heat, but the child was
shivering horribly, and his face was swollen and disfigured
with much weeping, and every little while he
gave a great gasping sob. Seizing the boy in his arms,
master carried him to his own room, put him in bed,
and ordered me to jump in, and lie close beside him.</p>

<p>Egbert did not dare disobey him. He cast one
frightened look after him, then he threw his little arms
so tight round my neck, that he almost strangled me.
“Muvver, muvver,” he muttered over and over, “oh!
muvver, muvver.”</p>

<p>He was a nervous, high-strung child, and I knew my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
master was terrified lest he should go the way of his
parents. I heard him telephone to Mrs. Bonstone to
come quickly. He knew the child ought to have a
woman to take care of him.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the night, but Mrs. Stanna got
there almost as quickly as the doctor did. From the
time she entered the apartment till five hours later, I
knew only the boy’s side of the story. Master disappeared,
for he had many things to do.</p>

<p>Stanna was lovely with the little orphan. She put
her arms round him, hugged and kissed him, and told
him a beautiful story about Walter Scott.</p>

<p>Just as she got to the most thrilling part of her
tale, Egbert said gravely, “What was on that piece
of paper that upsetted muvver?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone grew pale. The child was not
blinded by her attentions.</p>

<p>“Egbert,” she said trying to smile, and not succeeding
very well, “you know your dear father went
to the war.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said shortly, “to fight the Germans&mdash;the
devils.”</p>

<p>“Egbert,” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“That’s what Louis calls them,” he said in a matter-of-fact
voice.</p>

<p>“Of course, Louis is half French,” said Mrs. Bonstone
in a slow voice, and trying to gain time.</p>

<p>“Louis says he’d like to unjoint the Kaiser,” pursued
Egbert and he cracked his little finger joints as
though he would separate them&mdash;“All over,” he went
on, “limb by limb&mdash;Louis would enjoy doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone gave a nervous laugh, then tears
came in her eyes. “Darling,” she said coaxingly,
“your father was a splendid man. He would never
hate any one. All nations have good and bad people
in them.”</p>

<p>“Did the Germans kill him?” asked Egbert quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose they had,” asked Mrs. Bonstone,
“wouldn’t he be in that lovely place called heaven,
with the angels and the beautiful meadows, and watercourses,
and all the happy people who are through with
this wicked world?”</p>

<p>“And happy birds that fly about the altar,” added
Egbert, his little face lighting up. “Favver would
love that, but he’d rather be with me and muvver.”</p>

<p>This was a poser for Mrs. Bonstone. However, she
caught her breath, and was launching forth on a brave
description of the glories of heaven when the door
opened softly, and Mrs. Granton came in.</p>

<p>Naturally she didn’t like to see another woman in
her house in the middle of the night, but the terrible
circumstances blotted that occurrence almost out of her
mind. She narrowed her eyelids, and visualised her
boy in the place of Egbert. She was a real mother
now.</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Bonstone was on the whole a much
better woman, and she had been perfectly lovely to
her little brown baby. I don’t suppose, indeed, that one
could find a better counterfeit mother than she was,
but mistress was the real thing.</p>

<p>Something told her what the child was going
through, something told her what to do. She didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
try to tell him stories, she didn’t try to appeal to his
intelligence, she just smiled a triumphant mother smile,
held out her arms to the stricken child, and he went
into them.</p>

<p>She sat down on the bed, rocking herself to and
fro, and saying, “There, there,” and patting him gently
on the back while listening to his wild weeping.</p>

<p>His father and mother were dead, and his heart
was broken. That was the whole thing. All the clever
men and women in the world could not blind his eyes
to his own intuition. He didn’t reason, he knew.</p>

<p>Presently she turned to Mrs. Bonstone. The child
had whispered something in her ear. “Stanna,” she
said gently, “he wants to know if you will please go
to his play corner and bring all his toys here.”</p>

<p>With a somewhat mystified face, Mrs. Bonstone hurried
away and presently returned with the skirt of her
dress held up.</p>

<p>As she unloaded animals, toy guns, whistles, Noah’s
arks and every sort of game on the floor, I caught a
glimpse of her face.</p>

<p>Of course at mistress’ advent, I had jumped off the
bed. Mrs. Bonstone now looked strangely&mdash;almost
frightened, as if she had seen something that startled
her. With all my intuition, I was far from guessing
the truth, but I ran to the door and heard footsteps
in the hall, and smelt mystery. Well! it would wait.
I was more interested in the child than in anything
else.</p>

<p>“Has&mdash;has she got them all?” he gulped in mistress’s
ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Then let me go,” and he clambered off the bed,
and dashing away the tears from his poor red eyes, he
went over all his heap of toys, selecting about two-thirds
of them, and putting them in a heap, while he
threw the others under the bed.</p>

<p>The two women sat looking at each other, and at
him, with mystified glances. Finally, the child had
the toys all assorted, and with his little face disturbed
with rage, he jumped up and down on the heap, smashing
and demolishing animals, birds and games, and
toy-carts and engines.</p>

<p>When they were all in a disfigured, ugly mass, he
sprang back into the bed, and nestled against mistress’s
breast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone wonderingly picked up a section of a
box. Something was stamped on it, and she read it
aloud, “Made in Germany.”</p>

<p>Her face grew scarlet. “The whole war isn’t worth
the flame of rage in this one childish breast,” she said
furiously. Then almost in the same breath, she calmed
down, “But oh! my child&mdash;forgive, forgive. They are
your enemies, but only more war can come from vengeful
feelings. Don’t let us have the hate-song in this
country.”</p>

<p>I don’t know whether the child was listening. His
head was buried in mistress’s shoulder. Mrs. Bonstone
went on, “Your darling mother forgave, for the words
she wrote in her anguish all about the room, and on
that piece of paper, were: ‘I do not want my boy
to be a soldier.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Egbert still made no reply, and Mrs. Bonstone, getting
up, went to the hearth-rug, rolled it back, and
busied herself in making a fire. When it was blazing
nicely, she spread an eider-down puff over a big chair,
and said to mistress, “Your back must be aching, Clossie.
You would better sit here.”</p>

<p>Mistress smiled in a grateful way, and sitting down
in the big chair, took Egbert on her lap.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, and in came master.
He looked tremendously excited in a quiet way, but still
he took time to flash a glance of appreciation at his
wife.</p>

<p>Behind him stood a nurse&mdash;a strange nurse, not the
baby’s.</p>

<p>“Will you let me have the boy, please,” she said to
mistress, “and quickly. The doctor is waiting.”</p>

<p>Mistress let him go, then she turned inquiringly to
her husband.</p>

<p>He dropped down beside her, and laid his hand on
her lap. “A miracle, Claudia. The child’s mother has
come back to him. It was a case of suspended animation.
He probably saved her life by the application
of heat. I never heard of a similar occurrence. I
shall question the doctor later.”</p>

<p>“Oh! thank God, thank God,” cried Mrs. Bonstone,
and she sank on her knees at the other side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Mistress didn’t say anything, but she stared at me,
at her husband, and at Mrs. Bonstone. Finally she
murmured, “’Twas the dog that did it.” Then she
got up, and went quickly to her baby’s room. Taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
his little soft hand between her own, and very gently
lest she should wake him, she dropped loving mother
kisses on it.</p>

<p>I had followed her, and stood touching her gown
softly with my muzzle. She stooped down and patted
me, and from that day to this mistress and I have been
good friends.</p>

<p>When I told Walter Scott about this the next day, he
said: “It isn’t safe to judge any human being, or any
animal till they have lived their lives out. You used
to be too hard on your mistress.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">POOR AMARILLA</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Mrs. Waverlee had no relapse, and she went
to recuperate in the lovely hospital where my
mistress had been.</p>

<p>Master was questioned very much about her case
by his men friends, who said it was one of the most
extraordinary they had ever heard of.</p>

<p>Oh! the petting I got. I had really done nothing,
but follow out my dog instinct, but these human beings
seemed to think that there never had been, and never
would be such another dog.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee was a rich woman, and many persons
said, “She will be sure to give the dog a jewelled
collar when she gets well.”</p>

<p>Master and I were very uneasy about this, and he
said one day, “If she does, I shall not allow Boy to
wear it. Sometimes, jewelled collars have cost dogs
their lives.”</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Waverlee was something beyond
the ordinary run of women. When she came back
from the hospital, pale, but strong and beautiful, she
took my head between her two hands.</p>

<p>I never saw such a look in the eyes of a mortal person
before. (You know we dogs sometimes see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
ghosts.) She was like a woman that had died, and
come to life again. If there had been any nonsense
about her, it was all purged away.</p>

<p>“Boy,” she said in her lovely English voice, “to
commemorate your sagacity, I am going to give a year’s
income to aid the various societies in New York that
exist for the purpose of helping lost and starving
animals.”</p>

<p>Oh! how this pleased me. The sufferings of animals
affect me so strongly, that merely to think of them
makes me miserable. I try in vain sometimes to forget
the horrible sights I have seen, the dreadful sounds
I have heard.</p>

<p>I wagged my tail, I licked her hands, I prostrated
myself before this beautiful Englishwoman with the
other-world look in her eyes. She could do nothing
for me, but make other dogs happy, whose sufferings
made me so unhappy.</p>

<p>I adored her, I worshipped her. There was something
in her spirit that understood my dog spirit better,
far better, than any other person in the world could
comprehend me. What was it? I did not know. I
merely understood that I reverenced her more than
I reverenced my dear master, though of course I loved
him more.</p>

<p>The Bonstones and my master and mistress were
intensely interested in this lovely woman, for she affected
them somewhat as she affected me. For a long
time, after she came from the hospital, she and Egbert
visited the Bonstones, and Gringo told me that every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
one in the household looked upon her with a kind of
awe.</p>

<p>“She don’t care for things other women do,” said
old Gringo with a mystified air, “and I hear her whispering
to herself, ‘What shall I do with my life?’”</p>

<p>“Then she isn’t going back to England?” I said.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Gringo, “she grows quite cold and
white, when any one asks her that. I think it’s because
they’re still fighting over there, and she hates war.”</p>

<p>One day, he came over to our house on his most
excited double shuffle. “My boss has fixed the English
lily,” he said. “Out near his farm in the country,
is a village where the brown baby will have to
go to school bye and bye. He’s offered to build a
school-house, if Mrs. Waverlee will teach in it.”</p>

<p>“And will she?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“She’s tickled to death. Says to train children will
be just the ticket for her.”</p>

<p>Soon after this, Mrs. Waverlee came back to her
apartment in our house. I heard a very indiscreet
lady one day ask her if she didn’t dread going back
to the rooms where she had heard the news of her
husband’s death. Mrs. Waverlee gave the lady a
strange smile and said, “He isn’t dead to me. I feel
him near me all the time.”</p>

<p>Both Egbert and his mother visited us quite frequently.
They both loved the baby, and sometimes the
Bonstones came over with little Cyria, and we had
quite a party.</p>

<p>Little Cyria was a darling, and she was not at all
afraid of dogs. Every fine day her nurse took her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
out on the Drive, and she stretched out her little hand
to every dog she met. On windy days, and rainy days,
the nurses all took their perambulators up to Broadway
where it was more sheltered. If you notice the
New York babies in the vicinity of the Drive, you will
find that they all look very prosperous, for they are
kept out-of-doors so much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone fussed over Cyria, and mistress
fussed over George Washington, and the baby-interest
drawing the two ladies together so much, threw
the two men together.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Bonstone and my dear master were quiet
men, disliking society, loving business, and enjoying
nothing as much as a long walk together after their
day’s work was over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton was not strong enough now to go into
society, but Mrs. Bonstone was, and one day I heard
her husband talking to her very seriously, and telling
her that as long as she lived in the city, she ought to
keep up a certain amount of social life.</p>

<p>She adored him still, and never hesitated to tell him
so, and in the long run, she usually did as he requested.</p>

<p>“But I won’t go out in the evening,” she said wagging
her saucy head at him.</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied, “but mind you’ve promised
not to drop all the women you know. You’ll get
warped and selfish, if you do.”</p>

<p>“What a wise man you are,” she said teasingly.
“Do hurry and get your old farm ready, so I can be
a farmer’s wife.”</p>

<p>I was in the Bonstone house nearly every day, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
if I was not, Gringo told me all that went on. He
never ran out on the Drive without his master. He
was afraid of the policemen. On the Bowery where
everybody knew him, he had often gone out alone.</p>

<p>I was anxious to know what he thought of the baby
Cyria, and the farm, and one day I asked him to tell
me his real feelings.</p>

<p>“Cross-your-heart feelings,” I said. “I know you
don’t wear your heart on your sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Both things I hate,” he said grumpily, “but I’m
going to make myself like ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gringo,” I said, “how can you hate Cyria.”</p>

<p>“She sticks her fingers in my eyes when no one’s
looking,” he said.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that prove what I say, that children are
enormously clever,” I exclaimed, “but why don’t you
get up, and move away?”</p>

<p>“She’s master’s baby, she’s got to be amused.”</p>

<p>“But your master wouldn’t like her to do that.”</p>

<p>“She’ll get over it, when she’s older,” he said patiently.
“A dog has got to have some worries, or life
would be too sweet.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t like the idea of the farm?”</p>

<p>“A Bowery dog on a farm!” said Gringo. “Me
for the pavements.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever on a farm?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, and never want to be. I’ve heard tell what
they’re like. Nothing doing from morning till night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like the country half as well as the
city,” I said, “but I don’t believe I’ve ever been in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a really interesting country place&mdash;I’ll tell you a great
bit of news.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re going, too,” interrupted
Gringo.</p>

<p>“Yes I do,” I said, “master is going to move to the
country.”</p>

<p>“Well, I vow,” said the old dog. Then he added, “I
thought I smelt that rat one day when your boss was
talking to mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I went on, “your master is looking for a
place for mine.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad about having you near by,” said
Gringo, but he added shrewdly, “what does your missis
say?”</p>

<p>“She started it,” I exclaimed. “It began this way.
The other night she and master were talking before
they went to bed. Said she, ‘Rudolph, there is much
sickness in New York among children.’</p>

<p>“Said he anxiously, ‘Yes, I notice in the papers!’</p>

<p>“‘I’m worried about Baby,’ said she.</p>

<p>“‘So am I,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Country life is better for babies,’ said she, ‘but
I suppose you wouldn’t like to go so far from your
business.’</p>

<p>“Said he quite quietly, ‘I’ve always loved the country
better than the city, but I thought you couldn’t
abide it.’</p>

<p>“‘I used to dislike it,’ she said hanging her head,
‘but we had no baby then, Rudolph.’”</p>

<p>“And what did he say to that?” asked Gringo.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything. He got up and kissed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
her. They understand each other pretty well now,
and the next day, which was yesterday, he spoke to
your master, and asked him to look for a place near
yours. So you’ll probably have us for neighbours, old
boy. Isn’t that great?” and I gave him a playful nip
in his big shoulder.</p>

<p>Gringo was deeply pleased, but he’s like his master,
he doesn’t say much.</p>

<p>“We’re both no longer quite young,” I went on,
“and we’ve just got to make up our minds to like
what our owners do. I prophesy that two clever men
like your master and mine can make even country
life interesting.”</p>

<p>“Wait till they deliver the goods,” said the old dog;
then he added, “They’ll be missed in this little old
city.”</p>

<p>“But they won’t leave it finally,” I said. “They’re
planning to come in and out.”</p>

<p>I knew what he referred to. Mr. Bonstone and
my master had been placing more and more of their
business in the hands of their employees, and together
they went about the city doing good. They had found
out that a lot of harm results in many cases, from rich
people putting all of their charitable work in the care
of hirelings.</p>

<p>“Man to man,” master used to say, “I want to know
those I’m privileged to help,” so often he left his
office early, and he visited such poor places, that usually
I was not allowed to go with him. I heard him telling
his wife about the terrible suffering he found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have a war,” he used to say often, “unless
there’s more contact between class and class.”</p>

<p>“Don’t despoil yourself of all you have, Rudolph,”
mistress would say anxiously. “There’s Baby to be
provided for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to leave him a fortune, Clossie,”
he said one day. “A good education is all I wish to do
for him.”</p>

<p>“Just a little something to start on,” she said with
mother anxiety, then she went on, “I wish you wouldn’t
call me Clossie any more; say Claudia.”</p>

<p>Master was so pleased, that he went out and bought
her a beautiful ring, to commemorate the occasion of
dropping her doll name.</p>

<p>While master was doing a little missionary work
among human beings, I did a little among dogs, and
had an adventure in the bargain.</p>

<p>Of all animals in the world, I pity most the performing
animals. It is unspeakably pathetic to me
to see those poor four-legged creatures on a stage,
trying to do things they were never meant to do.
Why should a monkey ride a bicycle, or pretend he’s
a fireman, when he just hates it? I’ve seen human beings
in a theatre, shrieking with laughter at the antics
of poor animals on the stage, whose eyes were eloquent
with fright.</p>

<p>Once I had as owner a lady who used to take me to
the theatre. She always had a box, and concealed
by the flowing laces of her gown I would watch everything
that took place on the stage. Some things I
liked. I think men and women enjoy strutting round,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
pretending they’re some one else. But the dogs who
appear in vaudeville&mdash;it nearly used to break my heart
to see them.</p>

<p>Once I saw roosters&mdash;poor, thin, half-starved looking
creatures, who flapped their wings, and crowed,
and stretched themselves when they came on the stage,
showing that they had been confined in little cages, instead
of leading a free, open-air life as roosters
should.</p>

<p>Well, on the day, or rather the evening when I
played missionary, I had tried in vain to get Gringo
to take a stroll with me.</p>

<p>No, he would not, and lay down on a seat arranged
for him in a window, so he could watch the passers-by
in the Drive. Summer was coming, and it was too late
for fires, so he could not lie on the hearth-rug. Master
had gone off with Mr. Bonstone somewhere on the
East Side. By the way, I must not forget to say that
Mr. Bonstone had given up his last naughty saloon.
They were all good ones now.</p>

<p>He had a great scene with his wife, one evening
when I was present. He still clung to the Bowery
drinking-place, and she had found out about it. She
drew the most dreadful picture of Cyria growing up
and becoming a drunkard. Mr. Bonstone didn’t know
whether to laugh or get cross with her, for as Gringo
says, “My boss’s heart isn’t on the water-waggon.”
He believes in drink in moderation.</p>

<p>Well, Mrs. Bonstone cried, and at last her husband
comforted her, and said he would never sell another
drop of liquor as long as he lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor drink it,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I never have touched it&mdash;don’t
think it wrong, but hated the taste.”</p>

<p>He had to promise, of course. A nice woman can
do anything with a man, so now the Bonstones’ house,
like ours, was strictly teetotal, and if any persons
fainted, they were revived pretty quick with some hot
stuff that I think was mostly cayenne pepper, by the
way it made persons jump.</p>

<p>To come back to the evening of my adventure. I
slipped down Broadway, running close to the stores
and keeping the people between me and the gutter.
One seldom meets a policeman near shop windows.
It was a lovely evening, with a warm spring-like feeling
in the air, and this nice, wide, clean Broadway
fascinated me more than ever, and everybody looked
so happy and pleasant and well-dressed that I concluded
all the people with troubles had stayed at home.
Nearly every person had on new spring shoes. I
really think that nowhere in the world, except in Paris,
does one see such pretty, well-shod feet as in New
York. I danced along, meeting quite a number of
dogs, some of whom I spoke to, some of whom I did
not notice. The most of them were led, and of course
all had muzzles on.</p>

<p>I had passed several moving picture places and a few
vaudeville houses, when it suddenly dawned on me
that I was getting too far down Broadway, and had
better return home. I cut down a side street, but did
not get far, for just as I had gone a few steps, I smelt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
a smell, that took me back to Boston, and several years
ago.</p>

<p>I was living then on Beacon Hill, and <a href="#Fig_178">in the house
next to me was a fine little toy spaniel called Amarilla</a>.
She was a little darling, and had a way of tossing her
long ears as if they were curls. One day she disappeared
most mysteriously. No one could ever find
out what had become of the lost Amarilla, though it
was suspected she had been stolen.</p>

<div id="Fig_178" class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/p176.jpg" width="573" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN THE HOUSE NEXT TO ME WAS A FINE
LITTLE TOY SPANIEL CALLED AMARILLA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Amarilla had a very gentle, clinging sort of an
odour. She was an exquisitely clean little dog, but no
matter how clean dogs or human beings may be, they
cannot get rid of what Gringo calls their odoriferosity.
He vows he can track his master if he touches a thing.</p>

<p>Well, I was very much excited when I scented
Amarilla. The poor old lady who owned her was
quite childish, and she actually died of grief over the
disappearance of her dog. It would be a great feather
in my cap to track her. Yes, and get caught myself, my
native caution whispered to me.</p>

<p>I surveyed the scene&mdash;a vaudeville house on a quiet,
narrow street, enormously high buildings each side&mdash;a
fine place for a getaway as Gringo calls a scamper
from danger&mdash;well, I would risk something for
Amarilla.</p>

<p>The show had been going on for a little time, for it
was quite a bit after eight, and very often the door
opened and persons came out&mdash;presumably those who
had played their part for the last time and were going
home. So, if I ran in the door, and was cautious, I
would stand a good chance of getting out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>I seized my opportunity and bolted in when an enormously
fat lady in a light evening cloak came out, and
entered a taxi-cab that had been standing by the curbstone.</p>

<p>Now I was inside the door, and what did I see&mdash;a
bare, narrow hallway, and some steps. I crept cautiously
up the steps, nosing and smelling various odours,
animals, sawdust, straw, stale food, and waves of heat
from some badly ventilated hall.</p>

<p>Ah! here my suggestion of Amarilla stopped&mdash;it
was a medium-sized, untidy kind of basement room,
with boxes littered about&mdash;travelling boxes of animals.
All were empty. The animals must be on the stage
with their trainer, but if Amarilla was on the stage,
why was the room so strongly reminiscent of her?</p>

<p>Amarilla was not on the stage. I followed my nose
to a corner, and there was the dear little thing, crouching
low, her pretty open face, like a child’s, all distorted
by fear.</p>

<p>“Amarilla,” I said softly.</p>

<p>Oh what a jump she gave. “Beauty,” she said,
“why, Beauty, is that you?”</p>

<p>Beauty had been my name in Boston, given me by
a too fond mistress who really thought me beautiful.</p>

<p>“Tell me quick,” I said, “what’s the matter with
you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do my tricks right,” she said, “and the
trainer beat me, and I was too frightened to go on the
stage.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not happy with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Happy, Beauty&mdash;if you knew,” and she began, to
moan and cry softly.</p>

<p>There was blood on her pretty coat, and I said
sharply, “Brace up, now, and get out of this. Follow
me, I’ll lead you to a good home.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” she said shrinking back. “I never had
much spirit, and all I had has been whipped out of
me. I don’t believe I could run a block.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Amarilla,” I said earnestly, “do come with
me. If you don’t, I shall go home and dream of your
misery, and cry in my sleep.”</p>

<p>That touched her a little, for she always was an
unselfish little doggie. “Do come,” I begged.</p>

<p>For a few minutes she held out, and I was in an
agony. Any minute, her master might come and find
me there, and I should be trapped, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, Beauty,” she said despairingly, “I’d love to
go, but he would run after me, and then he would
nearly kill me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll lie down, and let him catch me, too.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said wildly. “You wouldn’t last any
time&mdash;a dog of your spirit.”</p>

<p>My threat decided her, and she consented to follow
me to the door.</p>

<p>Waiting there in wild anxiety, I thought it would
never open. We had to hide in a corner, and the
trainer was actually marshalling the other dogs down
from the stage to their travelling boxes, before a stage
hand came along and, opening the door, stepped out
in the street to get a breath of air.</p>

<p>I thought he would never move away from the open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
door. Finally a German band struck up on Broadway,
and he moved a few steps toward the corner.</p>

<p>I gave Amarilla a push, and didn’t we fly out! Most
unfortunately, as we scuttled along toward Riverside
Drive, he turned and saw us. He stepped back quickly
into the doorway, and I knew he had gone to give the
alarm.</p>

<p>“Run, Amarilla, run,” I whispered. “They’re after
us, and if they catch us, your trainer will tear me limb
from limb.”</p>

<p>Poor little soul, she was too wise to use her breath
for speaking. She just tore on behind me, and nearly
panted her little life out. I knew by her breathing
that she hadn’t been used to having much exercise. I
had told her to run behind me, and not to think of automobiles
or anything, but just to keep close to my
hind paws.</p>

<p>Of course, I led her right back to Broadway. It
would have been foolish to keep on toward the Drive,
when the man had seen us going in that direction, and
would likely get a taxi and follow us. I chose the
front of another moving picture place, and made her
creep in behind the billboards.</p>

<p>“This is horrible,” she gasped, “right in the jaws
of danger.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “just where they’ll never think of
looking for you,” and didn’t we, later on, have the satisfaction
of hearing one man say to another, “Hear
about Fifeson’s dogs down at the other house?&mdash;they’ve
lost one&mdash;saw her running off with another
dog&mdash;a white fox-terrier, and can’t find her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“How much was she worth to Fifeson?” asked the
man addressed.</p>

<p>“He reckons her at five hundred dollars, but I guess
he’s romancing.”</p>

<p>Amarilla trembled frightfully, but I reassured her
by licking her wounded head, and after a long time,
when the crowd was coming out of the theatre, I guided
her among ladies’ dresses, and creeping out, we rushed
down to the Drive again. Taking advantage of every
bit of shadow we could find, we made short runs for
home.</p>

<p>It was about eleven when we arrived in front of
our apartment-house, and Amarilla was nearly dead.</p>

<p>“Bear up a little longer,” I said to her. “Imagine
you’re one of your big ancestors taught to keep within
a short distance of a gun&mdash;and listen to a word of advice.
The lady of the house is your friend. Pay no
attention to the man.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” she said faintly. “I’m terrified of all
men, since that one has beaten me so much with his
cruel whip.”</p>

<p>Oh, how angry I felt. That terrible whip is in evidence
even on the stage, for did any one ever see a
show of trained animals, without the presence of the
scourge in the hands of the master? He doesn’t dare
to use it in public, but he shakes it, and the poor dog
knows what is coming afterward.</p>

<p>Oh! what a long breath I drew when we passed the
floor-to-ceiling mirrors of our hallway&mdash;safe at last,
and a sorry looking sight. Amarilla’s curls were muddy
and torn, for I had had her in vacant lots, among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
shrubbery, everywhere, to escape the sharp eyes of the
policemen. Then her own troubles made her look terribly.</p>

<p>“What a wreck,” she murmured, then she shut her
eyes in pain and fatigue, as she dropped to the floor
of the elevator.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got a friend,” said the elevator boy
with a grin. “You’re a great dog. Never saw your
beat.”</p>

<p>When I barked once at the door of our apartment,
which was my signal for getting in, I hoped fervently
that my master was at home.</p>

<p>Thank fortune, he was. I ran up to him, threw myself
across his feet, and panted, for even I, strong as
I was, felt rather worn out, but not so much with exertion
as with excitement of rescuing my former little
friend.</p>

<p>Amarilla, according to instructions, crept timidly to
Mrs. Granton’s feet. I never saw anything look more
humble than that little dog. She doubled up her little
legs so that she seemed to be crawling on her stomach.
Her air was humility, sad appeal, and restrained
suffering. It was inimitable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">TO LOVE OR NOT TO LOVE THE COUNTRY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Mistress laid down her work&mdash;she was always
making things for the baby now&mdash;and gave
a little shriek&mdash;“Rudolph, look here, what is this?”</p>

<p>“A dog on its last legs apparently,” he said, then
he gave me a shrewd look. “Something Boy has
brought in.”</p>

<p>“There’s blood on it and mud,” cried poor mistress,
shrinking away. “Take it, Rudolph. Ring for Annie.
Why, it’s been abused.”</p>

<p>Why, mistress was progressing. She actually could
make out something from a dog’s appearance.</p>

<p>However, it was one thing for her to tell her husband
to take it, and another thing for Amarilla to allow
him to take it. She yelled with fright, whenever
he came near her, and clung to Mrs. Granton.</p>

<p>“Some man has whipped that dog,” he said angrily.
“The brute! Poor doggie; I would not hurt you for
a kingdom.”</p>

<p>Protestations didn’t count with Amarilla. She didn’t
like men, and Mrs. Granton half flattered, half annoyed,
at last retired with her to the kitchen.</p>

<p>When she came back, a half hour later, Amarilla<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had been washed and brushed, and was wrapped snugly
in one of Master Baby’s white blankets.</p>

<p>Annie put her in a chair near Mrs. Granton who
sat ruefully surveying her.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” she said, “what do you think this
means?”</p>

<p>“From my knowledge of Boy,” he said, “I should
judge that this is either a lost dog, or some poor creature
he has coaxed from some kind of slavery.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is as intelligent as that?” she asked
surveying me kindly.</p>

<p>“As that, and much more so,” said my master. “I
think there is a whole world of dog psychology open
to those who will run and read.”</p>

<p>“I used to think dogs were stupid,” she said.</p>

<p>“In that you are not different from many persons,”
said my master. “Cultivate an animal, and you find
out how clever he is.”</p>

<p>“And human beings,” she said softly, “if you cultivate
them, you find out that they are not as stupid as
they appear.”</p>

<p>Master winced a little. He knew that in times past,
he had allowed her to think that she was not clever
enough to be cultivated.</p>

<p>“Claudia,” he said, “you are a very clever woman,”
then he burst out laughing, and she laughed with him.</p>

<p>“Poor little frightened thing,” she said at last, stroking
Amarilla as she lay beside her. “She was so hungry
and thirsty, Rudolph. And her poor bones are almost
sticking through her skin.”</p>

<p>My blood boiled in my veins, when I thought of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
dainty Amarilla’s previous life, and the cosseting she
had had from the old lady in Boston, but I must listen
to what mistress was saying about Beanie.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” she said hesitatingly, “I was thinking
of asking you if I could get Beanie back. I don’t think
I treated him just right.”</p>

<p>Master stopped to think a minute, then he said,
“Claudia, if I had given your dog to Mrs. van der
Spyten, would you have asked for him back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” she said quite shocked at the idea.</p>

<p>“Then why take him from a charwoman?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be mean,” said mistress slowly.</p>

<p>“And here you have a beautiful and valuable dog
right at hand,” said my master, pointing to Amarilla.</p>

<p>“As valuable as Beanie?” enquired mistress.</p>

<p>“Twice as valuable. Her points look to me about
perfect.”</p>

<p>“But she may belong to some one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find that out,” said master, and he did, for
he put a dog-detective on Amarilla’s track. The man
found out all about her. She had been stolen by a
tramp, who sold her to the dog-show man.</p>

<p>Master visited the show, and was struck with horror
at the appearance of the animals. Sitting near
the stage, he saw that they were all terrified of their
master. He threatened the man with prosecution, took
all his dogs from him, allowing him a good sum; and
best of all, finding out that he hated the show business
and wanted to be a chauffeur, but couldn’t afford the
training, he put him in a garage and paid his way
handsomely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>That was master all over&mdash;to make a good thing
out of an apparently bad one. He and Mr. Bonstone
were always doing it. Mr. Bonstone had more practical
knowledge of the ways of evil-doers than master
had. Master belonged to a fine old New York family,
and had never lived with all sorts and conditions of
men, as Mr. Bonstone had.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone was as ardent a dog-lover as master
was, and he bundled the whole dog show out to his
farm, where they were months in recuperating. They
had been starved, beaten, not exercised, and two of
them had to be mercifully put out of the way. There
were left two white poodles, they called the Frenchmen,
a mongrel, Yeggie by name, a miniature bull-dog
called Weary Winnie, Czarina, a Russian wolf-hound,
a Dandie Dinmont terrier called Cannie, and a bloodhound,
King Harry, and after a while we all got acquainted
with them. That was after the great change
came in our lives&mdash;the moving from the city to the
country.</p>

<p>I must not forget to say that Amarilla proved a
great success as a pet dog for mistress. She did not
care for very much exercise. She followed mistress
from one room to another of the apartment&mdash;in fact,
she was like a little shadow, and oh! how she loved the
baby. She would sit by his perambulator for hours,
and if any stranger came near, she barked in her little,
shrill voice.</p>

<p>Now, I get very fond of certain human beings, and
no dog could love a master better than I love Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Granton, but I never could keep at his heels all the
time.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Granton didn’t seem to mind being
shadowed, and Amarilla adored doing it, so there was
no reason why they should not both be satisfied. Every
man and every dog to his liking, and that reminds me,
how, oh! how am I going to like the country? The
time is drawing near for our removal. Mr. Bonstone
has found a beautiful estate for master. The change
in my life is going to be positive. I don’t want to run
away again. I want to stay with this nice man, but
can I, if he leaves my beloved New York?</p>

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont">BOOK TWO: MY LIFE IN THE COUNTRY</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWINS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Two years have passed away since I wrote the
first part of the story of my life&mdash;two whole
years, but they seem like ten, for so much has happened
in them, and so many changes have taken place
in me, that I feel like a different dog.</p>

<p>I have changed, human beings have changed, the
whole world has changed, for that terrible blasting
war in Europe is over. I thought when it was done,
that master would stop looking grave when he read
the papers, and mistress would stop crying over the
woes of the suffering babies and children, but they
look and act worse than ever.</p>

<p>It’s the readjustment master often says&mdash;the horrible
setting in order of countries disordered by crimes
of the worst species.</p>

<p>Sometimes he takes his little boy in his arms, and
says, “George Washington, I had rather have you
die now, than see you live to grow up and shed the
blood of a fellow-man.”</p>

<p>I don’t think there is any danger of George Washington<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ever killing any one. He is the fattest, sweetest,
dearest specimen of a boy baby I ever saw. He
has no temper, as cute little Cyria has. He jabbers
baby-talk, and plays with us dogs, and never hurts one
of us.</p>

<p>I heard master say the other day that he had no
liking for a man who never changes his opinion, and
I believe that saying is true with regard to dogs as
well as men. I never used to like babies. Why? I
never cultivated them. I love them now, because I
study them, and it is one of the pleasures of my life
to note the astonishing developments and differences,
between the rapidly growing and changing Cyria, and
little George.</p>

<p>Sometimes they bother me, but who has not trouble?
A dog that dreams through life, lives in a back yard
away out of sight, nobody notices or cares for. You’re
bound to have a scrap occasionally, if you come out to
the light.</p>

<p>I never liked living in a back yard, but I used to
run like a greyhound from disagreeable things, and
seek pleasant ones, and it kept me always on the jump.
Now I have made up my mind to stay by this family,
no matter what happens to them. There is great happiness
in an accepted family. I notice some human
beings are always trying to get away from their home
environment, and many times it is with them as it is
with me&mdash;it keeps them on the trot all the time.</p>

<p>I don’t want any one to think that I imagine I have
become a perfect dog. Good gracious, no! I am just
a good, plain, American every-day sort of a dog. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have no illusions about myself, or my owners. I want
to do my duty in the dog walk of life to which I am
called. I’ll go round a block to attend to my business
and avoid a fight, but if trouble meets me the other
side of the block, I’ll not dodge it, but I’ll grip it by
the throat and try to down it. If it downs me, I’ll
get up and shake myself, and hope for better luck next
time. To keep myself humble, I often say, “Great
Cerberus! what a fool I am, but still not half so much
of a fool as I used to be.”</p>

<p>Another most important opinion I’ve changed, is
that the city is a better place to live in than the country.
How could I ever have made such a mistake?
I’m a country dog, now and forevermore, and all my
dog set has gone over with me. The country to live
in&mdash;the city to visit.</p>

<p>You ought to hear old Gringo on the subject. “’Pon
my word, Boy,” he often says when we gossip together,
“I never dreamed that an old Bowery dog would get
so stuck on green grass and blue sky.”</p>

<p>The Bonstones live right under a long and beautiful
eminence called Green Hill. Their big, bare house
spreads out like a barn under the hill slope. They
haven’t one thing in that house they could do without.
They have no carpets nor stuffed furniture, no draperies
at windows, just plain shades, and their floors
are of some smooth, shiny tiles that can be flooded
with a hose, and the water runs down and waters window
boxes on the floor below. They haven’t a table
cloth in the house, but they have lovely things to eat
on tables of finely polished wood, and they have plenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of big, soft cushions and comfortable wicker chairs,
and many floor rugs that can be lifted easily and taken
out-of-doors.</p>

<p>It’s the most sanitary house I ever saw, and Mrs.
Bonstone says it reminds her of a hospital. However,
she does not complain. She says that a little while
after she was married, when she found her husband
wanted to come to the country, she said, “It’s the
man’s right to choose the place of domicile, and here’s
one woman that will let her man go further than that,
for he may build the house, and furnish it too.”</p>

<p>Everybody says it is an ugly house, and yet I notice
everybody likes to visit it, and sit by the big jolly fires
in winter, or loll on the spacious verandas in summer,
and partake of the fine meals that are served in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>All the jewelry and silver were banished from the
house long ago&mdash;they were sold for the benefit of the
unemployed, and Mr. and Mrs. Bonstone wear a sporting
sort of clothes, and a handsome couple they are.
He has got quite brown, and she has a magnificent
colour from being so much in the open air. She hasn’t
any bric-a-brac to look after, nor fol-de-rols such as
most women have, and even the servants are out a
great deal, for the Bonstones install in their house
every labour-saving device that is put on the market.</p>

<p>Cyria is a little beauty, and browner than ever, but
not foreign-looking. Strangers always think she is
the Bonstones’ own child. Six months ago, every one
said her nose would be put out of joint but it wasn’t.
It is straighter than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall never forget that wonderful event. Good
old Gringo, who has matured wonderfully since coming
here, and who has also seemed to grow younger,
for he has lost his rheumatism because he takes more
exercise, came over to our house one drowsy summer
day just gasping and panting with excitement. He is
always going about here with his double shuffle gait.
He has no health commissioner, and no policeman nor
muzzle to worry him.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” I asked, blinking at him sleepily.</p>

<p>“We’re ahead of you,” the good old dog snorted&mdash;“you’ve
got one baby only. We have three.”</p>

<p>“Not triplets,” I gasped.</p>

<p>The old dog gave me a look. “Of course not,
though if it had been triplets, it would have been all
right. We’ve got twins, Boy, but Cyria counts in. She’s
our baby, too. Come on over&mdash;come on over and see
them. We’ve all got rats in the garret over them.
We’re crazy, crazy, crazy&mdash;just think&mdash;two babies.”</p>

<p>“Boys or girls?”</p>

<p>“One of each, of course,” he exclaimed, his square
face alight with pride. “Come on, double quick.”</p>

<p>I capered back with him&mdash;it almost kills me to see
him run&mdash;bull-dogs weren’t built for grace. Of course,
I saw nothing of the babies, but we listened under the
window, and occasionally heard little faint peeps like
young birds.</p>

<p>“Look at mister walking in the blue garden,” gurgled
Gringo. “Wouldn’t you think he was tramping
on wool?”</p>

<p>The blue garden was full of blue flowers of different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
shades, and rocks, and rills, and rustic seats and
arbours. It was a delicious spot, and very æsthetic.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone certainly didn’t look blue. He was
walking to and fro quite quickly, in spite of the heat,
and occasionally he lifted his eyes to the sky.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t know whether he’s on his head or his
heels,” whispered Gringo.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man stooped down, and picked a
bachelor’s button to put in his coat. Then with a
broad smile, he picked another, and put beside it.</p>

<p>“Remembers he’s got to run double,” said Gringo
gleefully. “Believe me, I’m happy for mister.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to call your babies?” I enquired.
“You’ll never get such a good name as George
Washington.”</p>

<p>“We had only one ready,” said Gringo, “that was
John. I guess mister will settle on Mary for the girl,
if missis don’t object.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “you’re pretty close to us. John
and Mary are two of the oldest and best of names.
Nothing fancy about them.”</p>

<p>“Mister wants them to be good,” said Gringo. “He
says nothing else counts, if you haven’t got that rock-bottom
character. My! what a training they’ll have. If
they don’t want to serve their fellow-men, they’ll have
a fight with the missis. She has gone batty on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“I hear she even believes in women voting,” I said
cautiously.</p>

<p>“She believes in letting men, and women, and children,
and animals do everything they blank please,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
provided they don’t bang into any other men’s, women’s,
children’s or animals’ rights. Liberty for her.
None of your coop-me-up rules.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing she’s got out of that old society,
sleep-eat-and-play life,” I said.</p>

<p>“A mighty good thing,” observed Gringo. “She
was most dotty.”</p>

<p>“Hist!” I cried, “who’s crying?”</p>

<p>“Little Cyria,” said Gringo, “she’s a regular baby&mdash;temper
too&mdash;but our own.”</p>

<p>Poor little brown girlie&mdash;she trotted toward the
blue garden, ran up to the abstracted Mr. Bonstone
and clasped both his knees. “Oh! Daddy, Daddy,
Cyria’s mos’ dead.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, baby?” he asked kindly, and
sitting down on a rustic bench, he took the child on
his lap.</p>

<p>“Thomas’ little boy has been teasin’ me. I wented
up to the stable with nurse. The boy said, ‘Feel your
nose, little girl&mdash;&mdash;’” and she went on, to choke out
her story of despair. The bad boy had said she was
only a “’dopted” child, and now there were two babies
who were real babies, and she would either be sent
away or put in a corner.</p>

<p>She spoke very plainly for a child of little more than
three years, for she had been brought up with grown
people.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, won’t you love me any more?” she
cried. “Won’t you let Cyria sit on your knee?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I will,” he said. “Don’t believe any
of this nonsense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the bad boy said you had only two knees, and
where would I go?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said Mr. Bonstone
gravely, “we’ll strap an artificial knee on Daddy for
one of the babies&mdash;the boy for example. My right knee
belongs to you, my first little girl.”</p>

<p>“Daddy, what’s a ’dopted baby?” she asked pitifully.</p>

<p>“A ’dopted baby is something a little better than
your own baby,” said Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>The child suddenly threw her arms round his neck.
“Daddy, you is sweeter than the roses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone kissed her very affectionately, then
he said, “Come, see the new babies. You must choose
one for your own, and I will choose one.”</p>

<p>“I want the girlie,” said Cyria.</p>

<p>“Very well, you shall have Mary.”</p>

<p>“An’ she must go seepie in my beddie.”</p>

<p>“Possibly later, but not just now,” said her adopted
father; then he took her away in the house.</p>

<p>“Nice man, that,” I said.</p>

<p>“Rather,” observed Gringo wisely, and with an eloquent
shake of his square head.</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “I hear that old Mrs. Resterton
is coming out here.”</p>

<p>“She arrived to-day,” replied Gringo. “She stood
that big house in New York as long as she could. She
thought she was in heaven when the boss let her run
it, and she had what she’s been, longing for&mdash;that is,
lots of dough. But she isn’t as smart as little missie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
her granddaughter, and she found that though her
place was just as firm in sassiety&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Society, Gringo,” I said. “You never do pronounce
that right.”</p>

<p>“So-ciety then,” continued the old dog. “She was
as strong in it as Grant’s tomb, but the butterfly world
fluttered by, when she no longer had her gamesome
wasp. So she wrote mister. I thought he’d smother
laughing. He took the letter out to the orchard, for
the old lady didn’t want missis to know. She said in
it everything she didn’t mean, but mister read between
the lines. She missed her granddaughter Stanna, and
her great-granddaughter Cyria&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I like that,” I said, “when she fought so against
the child’s adoption.”</p>

<p>“Oh! forget that,” said Gringo, “anyway, she wanted
to come live here, and he let her come, and he’s going
to sell the house, and make a big figure on it for an
apartment-house site, and he’s going to get a coupé for
her to run about in, and have all the old ladies she
wants.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be agreeable, won’t she?” I asked anxiously,
for I hated to hear of anything clouding the Bonstones’
lovely home life.</p>

<p>“Agreeable, yes. She’s a comely old dear. Everybody
likes her. She minces round in her black silk,
poking her aristocratic old nose into everything, but
who cares? The servants favour her, and the missis
pets her like a baby.”</p>

<p>“But Master Carty,” I said, “I do hope he isn’t
coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s got to,” said Gringo uneasily, “as his home
with his grandmother is broken up.”</p>

<p>“There’s your snag,” I said.</p>

<p>Gringo looked gloomy. “You bet&mdash;the young rap
tipples all the time. The women can’t stop him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe country life will.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said the good old dog, “but I’ve seen
many lads going Carty’s way. I’ll tell you what mister
will do. He’ll give him a good fair showing, then
if he doesn’t make good, he’ll kick him out.”</p>

<p>“But what about the women?” I said.</p>

<p>“The women,” exclaimed Gringo with suppressed
rage, “I’m tired of this drink-martyr’s business. The
men have all the fun, the women all the pain. Every
time that young rapscallion comes out here, missis
sneaks up to his room to feel his coat pockets, and
search his suit-case, to find out if he’s brought any of
the powerful, and if she finds it, she cries, and pours
out half and puts water in, and if a caller comes, down
she goes, smiling as if she hadn’t a trouble in the
world. I’d like to chuck all the drunkards in New
York Bay with a rock on their necks.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Gringo,” I said, “that doesn’t sound
like you. Can’t you think of a way to reform the poor
wretches?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but shut off the liquor,” said Gringo.</p>

<p>I burst out laughing. “How you have changed, old
fellow. You used to be for high license, drink in
moderation, self-restraint, etc.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t work with sap-heads,” said Gringo. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
for drowning now. Do you know what missis did&mdash;had
that fellow put over her head.”</p>

<p>“You mean his bed-room&mdash;when he comes out to
visit?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;so she could listen for his step. When it’s
steady, she is gay. When he stumbles, and pushes the
furniture round, she is sad.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think your master would have allowed
that,” I said angrily. “It’s a shame for Mrs. Bonstone
to be so bothered.”</p>

<p>“Mister,” exclaimed Gringo, “do you suppose he
knows? Not a word of it. Women keep little tricks
like that to themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he won’t kill her,” I said. “I wish
we could do something to help her.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can,” said Gringo with a knowing air.
“Our owners don’t know how much help they get
from dogs.”</p>

<p>Old Gringo’s prophecy came true, and in rather a
funny way, later on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE SHOWMAN’S DOGS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It was six months ago that the twins came, and now
they are fine healthy young babies, being pushed
round in their perambulator all over the place by
their nurse, who is so well-trained and so up-to-date
that she is over-trained or “fine” as Gringo says.</p>

<p>Gringo and I were watching them one day a few
weeks ago, as we sat side by side up in the orchard at
the Bonstones’. This orchard is a little one containing
very old trees, and is never ploughed. It is
a lovely shady place to rest, for the grass is kept short
and is soft as a carpet. It has become quite a social
meeting-place for the dogs of the neighbourhood, and
we often discuss things there.</p>

<p>“Fine babies, those,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Gringo, “I suppose you wouldn’t
find a finer pair in the whole state of New York.”</p>

<p>“Do you like them better than the little girl, Cyria?”
I asked.</p>

<p>Old Gringo wrinkled his forehead. “I never think
about that,” he said. “They’re all ours, and I guess
the mister and missis don’t think of it either.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” I replied. “I’d hate to see the
little brown baby made uncomfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Gringo chuckled. “Those were great times back in
New York, but I’m glad I’m in this army.”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about it, you are firmly wedded
to country life now,” I said.</p>

<p>“Wedded, I guess so, and I often snicker to think
how I’d have fought to a finish any dog in the Bowery
that told me I’d get to praise the country and run down
the city.”</p>

<p>“And you thought you’d get bored here,” I said with
a sly laugh.</p>

<p>“Bored,” and he grunted happily, “what chance
have I? It’s up at daylight with mister, and out to
the stables and barn, laying out the day’s work for the
men, examining the stock to see they’re all first class&mdash;by
the way, mister’s going to make a fortune raising
colts, ’cause the war cleaned out all the horses&mdash;then
in the house for breakfast&mdash;I say, Boy, things do taste
good out here in this clear air&mdash;then in town in the
car, out again, and pottering around after missis and
little Cyria, out in the gardens and after the hens till
lunch time, then a drive in for mister, and a stop in
the village with him.”</p>

<p>“I say, Gringo,” I interrupted, “I believe of all the
things your master and mine have done out here, that
automobile school is the best.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said the old dog. “These lads
that my boss picks up out of prisons, and in the streets,
won’t settle down to anything that isn’t pretty lively.
They’ll break colts or hustle round a machine shop,
but they’ll not stick to indoor work.”</p>

<p>“That breaking colts is new business to me,” I said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“How can you take a pale, weak, city lad and make
him successful? I thought you had to have strong
men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the old brute way,” said Gringo. “You
begin now when coltie is young and tender. Hitch
him up with a little bit of something dangling after
him. Break him in gradually to something bigger.
Lots of these city yaps haven’t ever had anything to
like&mdash;anything decent, you know.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” I replied. “They’ve had nothing to
love.”</p>

<p>“There’s one rogue,” said Gringo, “who sleeps in
the boxstall with his pet colt, and ’pon my word, I’ve
seen him with his arm round its neck. He’s a guttersnipe,
and my boss will soon rout him out and make
him sleep in a bed, but he ain’t too hasty with these
low-life chaps.”</p>

<p>“What’s this new talk about jitney cars?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Our bosses have got a lot of second-hand cars,
and are doctoring them for some of our lads who can
run them about New York like a taxi-man does.”</p>

<p>“But a jitney is a five-cent fare thing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it pays. Catch my boss in anything that
doesn’t speak up when it’s spoken to.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” I said, “for then the boys will
be self-supporting.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t finish my day, Boy,” said the old dog,
“after we tot up things down at the village, we have
our supper, and don’t the food taste first-class, then a
short evening on the veranda, and then bed. I tell
you it’s a full day, as full as a Bowery day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed, and he laughed too; then I said, “I’m
mighty glad, old man, that the intimacy between our
two families has kept up.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said he, “but do you know what I overheard
when we first came out? Says my missie to your
missie, ‘Claudia, we are only a mile apart. If we see
too much of each other, we shall fight. We ’most did
the other day&mdash;and our husbands shouldn’t be too
much together. They’ll fall out, sure as rats.’”</p>

<p>“Did she says ‘rats’?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! that, or something like it,” said the old dog
so impatiently that I resolved not to interrupt him
again.</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, “says she, says my missie to
yours, ‘I’d hate to have a break,’ and your missie said
so would she, then they said they wouldn’t call for a
week, and next morning your missie was over to borrow
a pattern for a pair of knitted reins for Georgie
to play horsie, and my missie was back in the afternoon
to take her some sweet pickles she had been
making. So there you are&mdash;and I must not forget
to say that the two families were all over on your
veranda in the evening.”</p>

<p>“Good joke,” I said laughing heartily, “and we dogs
are just as friendly as the human beings.”</p>

<p>“Thick as thieves,” said Gringo, “and I must say
we’re a pretty good gang.”</p>

<p>As Gringo was speaking, two of the dogs in the
performing troupe that Amarilla belonged to, came
round the corner of the house. They are two beautiful
snow-white French poodles, and have exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
manners. When they first came out, they were thin
and frightened. That was before we arrived. By the
time we came, they were fat and prosperous and happy
looking dogs. On the stage, they had worn their hair
clipped in the approved fashion for poodles, and their
forelocks were tied up with ribbon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone took the ribbons off, for she wanted
them to be real dogs, she said, and they are only
clipped now when warm weather comes, and then all
over.</p>

<p>It does Gringo and me all the good in the world to
see the quiet delight these two handsome dogs take
in their well-ordered life here. They are full of interest
in American life. They were born in Paris, and
at first they thought the whole world was bounded by
the Seine where they used to be taken to be washed.
Then they were sold to this dreadful man, Fifeson, who
beat them sometimes, but not nearly as often as he
beat Amarilla, for poodles are naturally splendid trick
dogs, and learn things easily.</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “do you think these dogs are any
different from other dogs who have never been treated
cruelly?”</p>

<p>“’Course I do,” he growled. “Don’t you see they
ain’t like you and me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it,” I replied, “but I wanted to know
whether you did.”</p>

<p>“Their spirit’s broken,” he said. “The Frenchmen
are happy, but there’s a look in their eye, as if they
wouldn’t be surprised any minute, if some one up and
struck them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Weary Winnie doesn’t show it as much as they
do,” I said.</p>

<p>Gringo grinned. Weary Winnie was his pet among
the showman’s dogs. She was a fat, lazy, young miniature
bull-dog with a wrinkled muzzle that looked as if
she were always smelling something disagreeable and
one white tooth that stuck out beyond the others. She
came of grand stock, but was rather stupid, and had
played an old woman on the stage, being dressed up
in a shawl and bonnet. Amarilla says her beatings
were awful, for she couldn’t seem to learn the simplest
thing. The showman made her hold things in her
mouth, and at last he had to give up the pipe, for
she always let it fall out. Finally he tied a basket to
her lips, and the string hurt her.</p>

<p>When we came out here, she was taken over to
our house to be a playmate for me, but she used to
run away and howl about this place till at last master
asked Mr. Bonstone to keep her. When she isn’t
sleeping, she is paddling about after Gringo, and looking
just about as graceful as he does.</p>

<p>She sleeps in a box-stall in one of the stables, with
the Frenchmen. Mr. Bonstone likes to have plenty
of dogs about his horses, for they are such good guardians.
No stranger can get near the horses when the
dogs are at their post, and some of them are always
in or near the stables.</p>

<p>Gringo, of course, always sleeps in his master’s
dressing-room. He saved Mr. Bonstone’s life once,
out west, when a bad man who was his enemy crawled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in a window at night, and was just about to shoot at
that head on the pillow so dear to Gringo.</p>

<p>“How did you stop him?” I often ask Gringo, for
he loves to tell the story.</p>

<p>“Just took a playful leap at his throat,” the old dog
always says.</p>

<p>“And what did your master do?”</p>

<p>“Heard the rumpus, got up, and took the man’s
gun away.”</p>

<p>“And what did the man do?”</p>

<p>“Broke down, and wanted to shake hands with the
boss.”</p>

<p>“And what did your master do?”</p>

<p>“Shook, and told him to go home, and get another
gun.”</p>

<p>Gringo, of course, can leap like a cat, that being
one of the characteristics of a thoroughbred bull-dog.
He, however, can jump higher than most bull-dogs, for
the man from whom Mr. Bonstone bought him had
given him special training. He was a famous boxer,
and Gringo says he used to put on gloves and have
many a go with him. Gringo would spring at the
boxer’s chest&mdash;he was a six-footer&mdash;and try to bite a
button from his vest. The boxer would give him good
blows with his gloves, and drive him away, but Gringo
always came back. It was rough training, but it made
the young dog hardy.</p>

<p>Besides the Frenchmen and Weary Winnie, the
Bonstones have Yeggie, a mongrel, another one of
the showman’s lot. Oh! what an eloquent looking
little fellow he is. His eyes seem to be pleading with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
you to make up some message, that he is unable to
deliver.</p>

<p>Amarilla says he is another one that got plenty of
whacks from the showman. She says that look of
tears in his eyes, means that he is trying to tell you
of his troubles, so that you will sympathise with him.</p>

<p>All these show dogs have nightmare most horribly.
That is one reason why Gringo won’t allow Weary
Winnie to sleep in the house with him. He had her
in one night, and he said that though he was fond of
the creature, he couldn’t have her yelling blue murder
every hour in his ear.</p>

<p>Yeggie is young and dashing, and hasn’t very good
manners. He was a tramp dog when the showman
got him, and sometimes he annoys me by saying that
I, too, led a tramp’s life. I explain to him over and
over again, that a wandering dog isn’t necessarily
a tramp dog, but he can’t make the distinction. Poor
fellow, he hadn’t early advantages, and is rather inelegant
in his ways. We older dogs are always correcting
him, but he forgets easily and is still very
heedless. However, he has a very happy time, and
that is the main thing. He loves the men and the
horses, and always sleeps on the foot of Joe’s bed in
his room over the larger of the two stables.</p>

<p>Thomas sleeps in the other stable, and Czarina is
always his companion. She is a magnificent Russian
wolfhound, and is Mrs. Bonstone’s special pet, next
to Sir Walter, who is the favourite-in-chief, though he
is not very much with his mistress now on account of
his devotion to the hens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>I should have mentioned sooner this aristocratic
dog. From the start, Sir Walter liked the idea of
moving to the country, for it suggested his former life
in Scotland.</p>

<p>Gringo and I imagined he would be the show-dog
of the place&mdash;always in evidence on the avenue, in the
drawing-room, on the verandas, or hanging about the
automobiles.</p>

<p>To our amazement, that dog’s one idea when he
got to the country was to have something to boss. He
would have preferred sheep, but Mr. Bonstone could
not keep any, as we are too near the city. Sir Walter
could do nothing with the horses, for the men were
with them all the time, and told them what to do.</p>

<p>“He wants to run a show of his own,” Gringo used
to say, “and though I like the dog, he ain’t going to
boss me!”</p>

<p>He couldn’t boss me, either, and not one of the showman’s
dogs minded a word he said. He did fuss round
the Jersey cows a bit, but the lad that drove them
to and from the pasture wouldn’t have Sir Walter interfering,
so he took to following Mrs. Bonstone about
when she took care of her large flock of hens.</p>

<p>They were beautiful white Wyandottes, and were
kind and sensible. It is wonderful what intelligence
hens have when one treats them well. Sir Walter got
interested in them, found he could order them about
to his heart’s content, and when seeding-time came, he
had made himself so useful that kind-hearted Mrs.
Bonstone was delighted to be able to give them their
liberty, under his superintendence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Those hens knew just as well as Christians that it
was naughty to scratch up the seeds in the vegetable
and flower gardens, but they had a pleasant little way
of yielding to temptation till Sir Walter took them in
hand.</p>

<p>“Bow, wow! chickies,” he would say, running round
and round them, and carefully steering them away
from danger points to the orchard or the meadow, or
the new land that was being broken up by a plough.</p>

<p>Those hens minded him beautifully, and he was as
happy as the day was long.</p>

<p>At first, the other dogs would roar with laughter
to see him rush out to the hen-houses in the morning,
wait for his charges to be let out, and wander about
with them all day.</p>

<p>One day he caught Yeggie making faces at him, and
gave him a great walloping, and that taught all of us
to be more respectful. If he liked hens, he had a right
to associate with them.</p>

<p>“A gentleman can perform any kind of menial labour
without degrading himself,” Sir Walter said to
Yeggie, and emphasised it by a bite on the ear.</p>

<p>As time went on, the hens became more and more
of a passion with Sir Walter, and by the time the twins
came he was sleeping out in a kennel by the hen-houses,
and had a pet white chicken roosting on his
back. Its name is Betsy, and it is not to be killed,
but kept for him, as he is so fond of it.</p>

<p>Many of the Bonstones’ neighbours have hens stolen,
but no one now ever braves the army of dogs at Green
Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>One man tried it&mdash;a stranger who did not know
about the dogs. He had tramped out from New York,
and seeing the flock of Wyandottes on the farm as he
passed by on the road, he decided it would be a good
place to steal a few chickens. He lay hidden in some
bushes till night, then he crept cautiously to the barn.
Sir Walter met him, and growlingly escorted him to
his kennel. The other dogs scented a stranger, and
the unhappy tramp found himself confronted by
Weary Winnie, Yeggie, the Frenchmen and Czarina.
They did not bite him. Mr. Bonstone’s dogs, and
ours too, are trained never to put their teeth in a man
unless he is trying to kill them, or some human being.
We can nose, and push, and knock over, and grip, if
necessary, but not bite.</p>

<p>The poor tramp was in a dilemma, and finally he
crawled into Sir Walter’s kennel, and covered himself
with straw.</p>

<p>Cook was the first one up at the hen-houses in the
morning. She wanted fresh eggs for breakfast.</p>

<p>Seeing Sir Walter watching the kennel door with a
peculiar air, she went up and looked in, and screamed
when she saw a man’s head in the straw.</p>

<p>Thomas and Joe came running from the barn, and
ordered the man to come out.</p>

<p>“Sure and I can’t,” he said, “those gentlemanly dogs
have peeled every stitch of clothing off me.”</p>

<p>Sir Walter says his clothes were thin and old, and
they literally dropped off him, when the dogs pushed
him about.</p>

<p>Thomas howled with delight, and telling the man to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
shake off the straw in which he was buried, he sent
Joe up to the house for a suit of old clothes of Mr.
Bonstone’s. That tramp had the greatest admiration
for the dogs, and sat about the place for days smoking
and staring at them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone at last ordered him to get out. He
absolutely wouldn’t work, and busy Mr. Bonstone was
not the kind of man to have an idle person about.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">GOOD KING HARRY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">So much for the Bonstones&mdash;now for my own dear
family. We are not as high up among the hills
as they are. My master bought, not a regular farm
like the Bonstones, but what they call a gentleman’s
estate. It has eighty acres of ground, some woodland,
some meadow, a big old-fashioned flower garden, a
fine strip of land for vegetables, and a stately old
colonial mansion.</p>

<p>The house is situated on a bit of rising ground overlooking
the Pleasant River Valley&mdash;just a tiny, baby
valley with a slender thread of a river picking its way
among meadows of the greenest grass I ever saw.</p>

<p>The house is beautifully, even luxuriously, furnished,
but without a foolish expenditure of money. The
drawing-room is a dream. We dogs are allowed to go
in, if we are quite clean, and if we lie down quietly on
the big hearth-rug, and do not romp about and shake
ourselves.</p>

<p>Even if a dog does live in the country, there is no
need for him to be careless in his habits. I often tell
that to Cannie the Dandie Dinmont terrier, who fell
to our lot in the division of the showman’s dogs.</p>

<p>His coat is dense, hard and wiry, and it is some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
trouble for him to keep himself clean. Sometimes he
neglects himself a bit between his washings by Louis,
and then I scold him. He is a grey brindle in colour,
and a fine, sensible little chap, but inclined to reminisce
too much about his trials with the showman.</p>

<p>“Look ahead, little dog,” I often say to him, “and
not over your shoulder.”</p>

<p>He never resents my criticism. He is a very docile,
courageous and affectionate dog, and a great favourite
with every one here.</p>

<p>Beside Cannie, we have <a href="#Fig_216">King Harry, the best specimen
of a bloodhound I ever saw</a>. His magnificent
domed head, and wrinkled forehead give him an appearance
of great wisdom. His eyes are small and
deep-set, with a third eyelid. His ears are long and
fine in “leather,” and hang close to his kind old cheeks.
His muzzle is long, deep and blunt at the tip, and he
has a dewlap in the front of his throat.</p>

<div id="Fig_216" class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">
<img src="images/p210.jpg" width="576" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING HARRY, THE BEST SPECIMEN OF A BLOODHOUND I
EVER SAW</p></div>
</div>

<p>Oh! what good talks I have had with this noble
dog. He has told me the whole history of his race.
I never knew before that they are called bloodhounds
because they were used first of all to track wounded
animals. They were known in ancient Gaul, and there
is distinct mention of them in England during the reign
of Henry the Third. De Soto in his expedition from
Spain to Cuba brought a pack of bloodhounds with
him to subdue the natives. Some of these same hounds
were brought to our Southern States, and now there
are plenty of them there, and they are known as “man
trailers.”</p>

<p>So the present American bloodhound is a descendant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the old Spanish kind. King Harry is of English
stock. He says his grandmother, old Lady Gray, had
the longest list of cases to her credit of any dog in
America.</p>

<p>When I asked him, one day after we first came here,
what he meant by that, he said that she had captured
thirty criminals&mdash;men and women who had burnt
houses or killed some one.</p>

<p>“How would she do it?” I asked him.</p>

<p>He said he had asked his grandmother many times
to tell him about the way she was trained, and she
said that she was one of a litter of five puppies. Now
her owner wished to know which of the puppies had
the best nose, so he used to approach the tightly
boarded side of their yard on tiptoe, and put his eye
at a knot-hole.</p>

<p>“Oh! I see,” I exclaimed, “that was to find out
which pup discovered him first.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied King Harry. “My grandmother was
always the first to wind him, so he gave her special
training. When she was four months old, he taught
her to lead quietly, neither pressing forward, nor holding
back on the chain. Next, she was taught to follow,
and to come at a whistle.”</p>

<p>“All this was for obedience, I suppose,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and to form her character,” said King Harry.
“Next she had to learn to jump in and out of a buggy&mdash;there
were no automobiles then&mdash;to climb fences,
to swim creeks, to get accustomed to the noise of a
town, and to become used to strangers, but never familiar
with them. She was not allowed to play with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
children, nor with other dogs&mdash;just with her owner,
Tim Dobson.</p>

<p>“When she was eight months old, Dobson took her
to the woods. A stranger held her by the collar, and
Dobson started off with an old towel in his hand.
He kept shaking it at my grandmother, who strained
at her collar, and was finally released by this assistant.”</p>

<p>“Why the towel?” I asked.</p>

<p>“To make her anxious to play with it, and to reach
her master. This was the overtaking lesson, and it
was repeated several times, then came the lesson in
trailing. Dobson hid behind a tree, and when he was
out of sight, the assistant released grandmother. As
soon as she reached the place where she last saw
Dobson, she dropped her nose to the ground. She
never had much trouble in owning a trail&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Recognising the scent of the person she was following&mdash;she
had a grand nose, and Dobson used to
keep bits of meat in his pocket to reward her for quick
work. She was taught to bark on trail, and bay at
hiding-places. Then when she was well educated along
this line, Dobson changed places with his assistant.”</p>

<p>“You mean Dobson ran with your grandmother,
and together they trailed the assistant.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dobson kept changing his assistant, so she
wouldn’t get familiar with him. He would make him
strip off his coat, and run. Then grandmother would
smell his coat, the older the coat the higher the smell,
and Dobson would run with her, and encourage her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to trail him. The assistant used to have other men
cross his trail, he would wade in creeks, and walk
along fences, but grandmother nearly always got him,
even when she had to work out a cold scent.”</p>

<p>“I would like to have seen that fine Lady Gray,” I
said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I am said to look exactly like her,” said King Harry
with a melancholy smile, “but alas! I was stolen when
a puppy, and I can do only amateur work at trailing.
However, if you just want to see my grandmother,
look at me.”</p>

<p>I smiled, and he went on. “Next thing came the
taking up of a trail with which grandmother was unacquainted.
Dobson had the man who was to be trailed
go to an old stable with an earth floor. He would
walk about a few minutes, throw down his hat, and
leave the place. In ten minutes, Dobson would take
grandmother there, keeping every one else out, let her
smell the hat, then hunt up the owner.”</p>

<p>“How interesting all this is,” I exclaimed. “I had
no idea such pains was taken with the training of
bloodhound puppies. I thought the trailing gift came
by instinct.”</p>

<p>“Everything that’s worth anything costs trouble,”
said King Harry. “Grandmother said as soon as she
learned how to take a trail freely and eagerly, she was
entered to horse and man trailing.”</p>

<p>“How do they do that?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“The assistant led the horse thirty yards, being
right out in front of him, so the horse would be on
his trail, then he mounted, rode thirty feet, dismounted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
led the horse fifty feet, mounted, rode one hundred
feet, dismounted and led.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “no wonder your grandmother became
so clever.”</p>

<p>“Clever,” repeated King Harry, “she was a marvel.
She once followed a trail that was thirty hours cold.”</p>

<p>“Whose trail was that?”</p>

<p>“A poor, crazy, coloured woman. She had set fire
to her house, tried to kill her husband, and then ran
like a fox to a swamp. Grandmother followed her
from seven o’clock one evening till two the next morning,
and the poor creature was found more dead than
alive, and put in a hospital where she subsequently recovered.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that bloodhounds are very fierce in
disposition, but I don’t find you so,” I said.</p>

<p>“Some of them used to be made so,” said King
Harry, “but they are really just like other dogs. Treat
them kindly, and they will treat you kindly, and a
bloodhound can be trained not to lay hold of a fugitive.”</p>

<p>“I say, King Harry,” I remarked, “dogs are wonderful
creatures. It’s a pity men don’t understand
better how to utilise them.”</p>

<p>“What gets me most of all,” said the dog in his
melancholy voice, “is the unappreciated devotion of
dogs. I heard your master telling the other day of a
friend of his who was in Belgium during the late war.
He said that no human beings were more faithful than
dogs; that the red-cross animals were simply magnificent,
and even the poor house-dogs who were left in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Belgian villages, when their owners fled for their
lives, were so devoted that they sat by their kennels
till they dropped dead. Even when food was offered
them, they turned their heads away. The poor starving
brutes thought it was right for them to stay by
their ruined homes, and not to take food from strangers.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about that war,” I cried, “don’t talk
about that awful war&mdash;I’m trying to forget it. Come
on down to the village. There’s to be a feast in
Neighbourhood Hall.”</p>

<p>Good King Harry pricked his drooping ears, and
ran along with me. This Neighbourhood Hall was
one of the grandest institutions I ever heard of, but
I will tell of it later on, for I want to give an account
now of something King Harry did to help along
the work master and Mr. Bonstone were engaged in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE REFORMED SHOWMAN</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">King Harry, as he said, had never been trained
as his grandmother was, for he had been stolen
when he was a puppy, but he inherited enough trailing
instinct to do pretty good amateur work, and we dogs
were always setting him tasks, and were surprised at
his cleverness in picking up a trail.</p>

<p>One night, shortly after my conversation with him
about his grandmother, we gave him something to do
for our owners. We thought at first that there was
going to be a serious case, but in the long run it turned
out more happily than we thought it would.</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock on a fine spring evening.
There had been a lot of cold weather, when suddenly
this glorious day burst upon us, like a harbinger of
summer. Everybody had been out-of-doors all day
long, and master and mistress sat on the front veranda,
too contented to go to bed.</p>

<p>Little stars peeped timidly from a somewhat misty
sky, and the river babbled happily of even warmer days
to come, and summer delights of flower and song, for
the birds were beginning to return from King Harry’s
sunny South.</p>

<p>Master sat in a big chair, mistress was swinging in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a hammock, Amarilla was cuddled in her arms. I lay
under the hammock, King Harry was sprawled on the
gravel walk below, and Cannie, the Dandie Dinmont
terrier, had gone down to the river to get a drink.</p>

<p>We had steps down to the pond near the house
where the goldfishes were, but he never would drink
from the place where those yellow things lived, as
he called mistress’s Japanese beauties.</p>

<p>The night was very still, and presently I heard
Cannie’s soft paddies coming back, pit-a-pat with excitement.</p>

<p>King Harry didn’t notice this. The good dog depended
more on his nose than his ears and eyes. Perhaps
from having been with human beings so much,
I see and hear more quickly than most dogs. Something
was the matter with Cannie, that was one thing
sure.</p>

<p>I ran down the veranda steps, and put my muzzle
close to his. “Lie down, and out with it,” I said.</p>

<p>He flopped on the gravel beside King Harry. Now
our heads were all together&mdash;the bloodhound’s dome,
my sloping head and strong, muscular jaws, and Cannie’s
hairy nose.</p>

<p>“Something’s gone wrong,” he said with his strong,
Scottish accent. “I was wandering down yon by the
alders near the river, when I heard a furious noise of
something being driven hard. It was an automobile
coming from New York way. It stopped short when
it got near me, and turned in among the alders. I
scampered out of the way, and a man hid it in off the
road. Then he sprang out, and tore up across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
turnip field toward Gringo’s house. I was too far off
to smell him, but I got a verra uneasy impression.”</p>

<p>He stopped, and both dogs looked at me. I had
been with the Grantons longer than they had, and they
were waiting for my advice.</p>

<p>I was puzzled. “If it were an ordinary case of big
country-houses and rich people,” I said, “I would imagine
it an attempt at burglary. But you say the man
was alone.”</p>

<p>“Stark alone,” said Cannie.</p>

<p>“And he left his car there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, down yon,” said the little dog, nodding toward
Pleasant River.</p>

<p>“You see,” I went on, “master and mistress and the
Bonstones haven’t anything worth stealing, but grandfathers’
clocks, and pianos, and old furniture. They’ve
given away jewelry and silver, and anything that would
tempt their fellow-men. However, it’s our duty to investigate.
Lead on, Cannie.”</p>

<p>He galloped ahead with King Harry, and I paused
an instant and listened.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” my mistress was just saying, “I’m
sleepy. I think I will go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Very well, darling,” he replied, and he got up and
helped her out of the hammock, and opened the screen
door for her.</p>

<p>“I think I will sit a while longer,” he said as he
kissed her. “I have a little business to plan out.”</p>

<p>“And I have been keeping you from it by my chattering,”
she said. “Why did you not ask me to keep
still?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I preferred pleasure to business,” he said
gallantly, and she laughed, and went to bed.</p>

<p>That just suited me. She would be out of the way
if we wanted master, and he was sure to sit for a
while, for he was a most scrupulous man about keeping
his word, even to himself.</p>

<p>I raced after my dog-brothers. The night did not
seem as dark as to human beings. Cannie was on his
hind legs peering into the car, and King Harry was
up on the seat, snuffing and blowing over a pair of
driving gloves.</p>

<p>I stood and listened for a minute. What an exquisite
night! The lovely misty sky spread above us
was serene and comforting, the great dark earth was
warm and palpitating&mdash;one could hear things growing.
Talk about the quiet of the country&mdash;this country just
talked, when a dog had ears to hear. The tiny growing
leaves of the trees had one language, the grass had
another, there was no mistake about the joy of the
frogs&mdash;they were simply yelling with delight to think
that summer was coming.</p>

<p>Just here King Harry jumped down. “I needn’t
have stayed so long,” he said, “but I wanted to do
some fine work.”</p>

<p>“What have you found out?” I asked. “Your eyes
are blazing.”</p>

<p>“It’s that demon Fifeson,” he said. “No trouble to
find his scent, but I wished to know whether he’s after
good or evil.”</p>

<p>“I hear he’s reformed,” I said, “and is doing well
in a garage on Broadway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hate him,” said King Harry. “I suppose it’s
wrong, but it will take years for me to get over my
resentment toward him. He never hurt me much. I
had simply to draw a wagon on the stage, but it used
to make my blood boil to see him flog that small Amarilla.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, old man,” I said, “tell us
what you’ve discovered.”</p>

<p>“When a man is in a furious rage, and about to
commit a crime,” said the hound, “a strong acrid smell
emanates from him. Those gloves are damp and excited
as to scent, but not criminal. I guess Fifeson is
here on business.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s good business,” I said.</p>

<p>“We canna tell,” said the little Scotch dog cautiously.
“For what did he hide his car? I suspicioned who it
was, but didna care to tell till I was sure.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” I said, “let’s follow him.”</p>

<p>King Harry put his old muzzle to the ground, but
before he did so, he said, “Of course, I’ll follow mute.”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, and we started off up the road,
going not very fast, as King Harry was not an expert
trailer. He nosed to and fro, and Cannie said impatiently,
“I tell ye, man, he crossed the turnip field.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to be ‘lifted,’” said King Harry
stubbornly. “You never indicate to a hound the direction
in which his quarry has gone. I’m doing this,
anyway. Kindly hold your tongue.”</p>

<p>The abashed Cannie slunk behind me, and we went
up across the turnip field in King Harry’s good time,
down to the hollow where the long meadow grass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
grew, across it through the pinewood belonging to us,
and into the pasture belonging to Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>The sweet wild grass was soft to our paws, and we
skipped over the many rocks sticking their ribs up
through the ground. We cantered easily along, and
King Harry took us to a path leading to the young
orchard at Green Hill, then to an asphalt walk that
ran from the house down to the electric car track in
the road. This walk was for the convenience of the
farm hands when they wanted to take the car to the
city. The men would start out from their rooms over
the stables with nicely blacked shoes, and Mrs. Bonstone
had suggested that this walk be made, so they
could arrive in the city with smart looking feet.</p>

<p>Well, King Harry soon had us in the vicinity of the
stables. This meant that all the Bonstone tribe of
dogs had to have a muzzle in the affair, though we
would just as soon have worked the thing alone.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott was the first to challenge us.
“Woo, woo,” we heard in his deep growl, as he lay
crouched behind an apple tree.</p>

<p>As quick as a flash, his tone changed. Our scent
had been borne on the night air. He ran to meet us,
nosing hurriedly, to find out what this late visit meant.</p>

<p>“Wow, wow,” came from the stables in Yeggie’s
sharp voice, and without waiting for Joe to wake and
let him out, he took a flying leap through the open
window to the roof of the harness-room, and came
limping to greet us.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” I said irritably. “Why don’t you wait
and think, before you bark?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yeggie always barks first, and thinks afterward,”
said the little dog, and he licked my ear so humbly,
that I had to forgive him.</p>

<p>Czarina came among us like a silent shadow, and
poked her long muzzle at me. “What’s the matter?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Good London, he’s off,” I replied inelegantly; “all
the king’s horses and all the king’s men can’t turn
King Harry from his trail.”</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got to trail him,” said Czarina, “for
he’s out of sight,” and she put her muzzle to the
ground.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll stay with the hens,” said Sir Walter,
sitting down outside his kennel. “Betsy’s in there,
and she’s fussing, for she can’t see well at night. Bark,
if you want me.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Weary Winnie sleepily. She
was always the last to arrive, and now she stood blinking
drowsily at us, and wrinkling her nose more than
ever.</p>

<p>“We’re man-trailing,” I said; “come on, youngster,”
and off I started.</p>

<p>By this time, every dog had caught the scent of
Fifeson, and they were a mad-looking lot. If they
had followed the natural impulses of their plain dog
hearts, I think they would have liked to tear that man
to pieces that quiet summer night, but they were
trained animals, and each one knew if they dared hurt
so much as a hair of his wicked head, they would be
severely called to account by Mr. Bonstone. So merely
growling unutterable things, they all pressed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, we brought up short near the house.
There had been an old well on the place for a long
time. It was, strange to say, close to the front door
of the present house, which was built in a slightly different
place from the old farm-house. The well had
been built over, and a bird’s bath tub was on the top
of it, surrounded by a clump of syringa bushes, so the
pretty feathered things could bathe in the privacy that
they love as much as human beings.</p>

<p>“The brute’s in there,” hissed Cannie between the
two broken-off teeth, knocked out by the amiable Fifeson.</p>

<p>At that instant, I felt a soft impact against my
throat, and mighty glad I was that I stood on good
terms with Gringo.</p>

<p>The old fellow had slipped down from his master’s
bedroom by the winding staircase that led from an
upper to a lower veranda. Mr. Bonstone never shut
up, by night or by day, the best friend he had. He
was at liberty to roam all over the farm if he wished.</p>

<p>Gringo’s old lay-back nose wasn’t as good as mine,
but he felt that friends were abroad, and he was right
on the spot to help us if necessary.</p>

<p>“It’s Fifeson,” I said. “I might have known he was
near, for Amarilla has been trembling all day. She’s
as sensitive as a baby.”</p>

<p>“What’s up with Fifeson?” asked Gringo.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s all right,” I said, “but we’re watching.
He’s in that syringa bush.”</p>

<p>Well, there we sat for a short time&mdash;King Harry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Gringo, Czarina, Cannie, Yeggie, Weary Winnie and
myself. The Frenchmen didn’t turn out.</p>

<p>The air was so clear that we could hear every word
spoken on the veranda. Though it was late, a neighbour
and his wife were calling on the Bonstones, and
we could hear the clink of glass, as bottles and glasses
touched each other.</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the Fifeson dogs. They all
hated the sight and sound of a bottle, for it was when
their master was drunk that he beat them most.</p>

<p>A thought came to me. I whispered to Cannie,
“Come on home with me,” and followed by him, and
taking the shortest cut known to us dogs, we just
galloped back to the Pleasant River house.</p>

<p>Master was still dreaming on the veranda. “Stay
here and watch the house,” I said to Cannie, “I’m
going to take him back with me.”</p>

<p>It was the work of an instant, to spring at master’s
arm and look at him with my most burning glance.</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” he said; “I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>He turned round, glanced at Cannie who was sitting
close to the door, not very well pleased at being
left out of the fun, then ran, actually ran, to the
garage with me, for he saw the occasion required
haste, and got out his new French racing car. I sprang
to the seat, barked in the direction of Green Hill, and
in a few minutes, we streaked up in front of the Bonstones’
house.</p>

<p>The callers departed, when master arrived. Gringo
said they had been there for an age. Master sat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
down, and the Bonstones began talking to him, but he
didn’t say much.</p>

<p>He kept looking at me, and presently I led the way
to the syringa bushes. He saw the dogs sitting round,
and said in a low voice, “Hello! there&mdash;come out,
whoever you are.”</p>

<p>I thought to myself: master is a clever man, the
Bonstones are clever people, but not one of them
knows what we dogs have sensed&mdash;namely that there
is a man in the bushes, and we know all about him,
except his business here, which, however, we are sure
is of a pacific nature, and not criminal. And some
people say, dogs are not clever!</p>

<p>The bushes parted, and Fifeson came out, looking
very hot and sticky. He is a weasel-faced little man.
With that appearance, I don’t see how he can be a
decent chap, but he’s making a brave fight for it.
I hated him almost as much as the other dogs, and
with a growl, I stepped aside for him to pass me. I
did not want the brute to touch me.</p>

<p>Keeping close at master’s heels, I listened to hear
what Fifeson had to say for himself.</p>

<p>“I say, sir,” he said in a low, almost agonised voice,
“for heaven’s sake send Mr. Bonstone down here, and
don’t tell his wife who it is&mdash;it might cost me my
life, sir&mdash;it might.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said my master, “don’t be scared. Only
the dogs know, and they won’t peach.”</p>

<p>Fifeson had seen us. He knew that though the
dogs hated him, they would not hurt him. He had
been their master. Even in the midst of his perturbation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
he clicked his dry tongue, and snapped his fingers
at his old victims. Not one of them would go near
him. Weary Winnie made a kind of shuffle toward
him, but Gringo growled at her, and kept her from
carrying out her impulse. The dogs wouldn’t hurt
him, but they wouldn’t forgive him.</p>

<p>I ran after master to the veranda. “Norman,” he
said carelessly to his friend, “a man has come from
New York to see you on special business. He doesn’t
want his presence known. Just step down to the
syringas, and speak to him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone is a very clever woman. She gave
master a quick look, and catching up her little silk
wrap said, “Good night, I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, Mr. Bonstone brought
Fifeson up on the veranda, and gave him something
to drink. He gulped down his ginger ale in a flash,
and said a few hasty words.</p>

<p>His breath was nearly all gone, for the night was
warm, and he had rushed uphill part of the way.
However, he had had time to recover himself in the
bushes. I think perhaps it was fear that made him
hot.</p>

<p>“You know Jones’ big jewelry store down town,”
he said to Mr. Bonstone in a low voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone nodded.</p>

<p>Fifeson pulled his chair further in the shadow of
the wall. “I say, turn out some of the lights, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Master jumped up, and turned out every one, while
the man went on whispering to Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s going to be broken into at two o’clock to-night.
I believe you set Jones up after he failed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone nodded again.</p>

<p>“I knew you had big money in it,” Fifeson gasped.
“Get to town quick. Get a friend to make the police
wise. Don’t go to headquarters yourself. You did
me a good turn. I thought I’d stand by you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Mr. Bonstone briefly. “Shall I go
back in your car?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Lord, no,” said the poor wretch in an agony.
“I may get shot for this, anyway.”</p>

<p>He was breaking away, when Mr. Bonstone caught
him. “How did you find out?”</p>

<p>“Was in the garage under a car&mdash;two gangsters
came in to hire an auto&mdash;I caught a clue and followed
it up.”</p>

<p>He paused in some embarrassment, and Mr. Bonstone
said, “All right, go. I’m obliged.”</p>

<p>Fifeson shot out into the night, and not a dog followed
him this time.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone turned to my master, “Fifeson has
had some dealings with the underworld that he doesn’t
want to reveal. Now, how am I to get to town?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you in the racer,” said master pointing
to his French car.</p>

<p>“I’ll say a word to Stanna,” said Mr. Bonstone, and
he leaped upstairs calling over his shoulder, “Czarina.”</p>

<p>Czarina told me afterward that Mr. Bonstone shot
into his wife’s bed-room, exclaimed, “I’m going to
town&mdash;will explain later. Keep the hound with you
for company. Everything’s all right, but dress yourself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and telephone Thomas to take you over to
Claudia. Tell her Rudolph is with me. We’ll be
back in a few hours. Not a word to a soul about the
man who was here.”</p>

<p>Czarina says Mrs. Bonstone smiled brightly, never
asked a question, motored over to my dear mistress’s
house, told her the two men had gone off to the city,
probably on one of their errands of mercy.</p>

<p>I think mistress was a little worried, for Czarina
says she called for Cannie, King Harry and myself to
watch in the house till master returned. She got King
Harry and Cannie, but not your humble servant, for
I had sprung first in the car, and was flying to New
York on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>The car is a beauty, and as there were few machines
on the road, master didn’t trouble about the speed
limit. We didn’t go quite into the city. We stopped
at the Johnsons’, where Louis and I had had the adventure
in saving Lady Serena Glandison from drowning.
Mr. Johnson, fortunately, was just getting home
from his club in his own car. A few words to him
from master, and back he went to the city, to put
detectives on the track of the wicked young burglars
who were going to steal Mr. Jones’ diamonds.</p>

<p>The burglary didn’t come off, two men were caught,
and sent to Sing Sing, though one escaped, and best
of all, Fifeson’s connection with the affair was never
suspected, as it had been managed in such a roundabout
way.</p>

<p>Fifeson went on from better to best, and now he is
chauffeur for a millionaire, and we dogs often see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
him driving about in a smart maroon livery, and with
a smile of smug respectability on his weasel face. I
hear he has just married a very respectable Norwegian
girl. I don’t believe he told her his past. The millionaire’s
dog told Gringo that if any woman could
keep a man straight, it would be that light-haired Norwegian
Anna.</p>

<p>Women seem to have a great deal of influence over
men. I suppose if all the women in the world were
good, there would be no bad men.</p>

<p>I heard mistress talking to master about his hurried
trip that night, and she was gently trying to find
out what it had all been about.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you names, dearest,” he said. “It
might cost a man his life. I will merely say that a
man whom I began to help, and who was taken hold
of by Bonstone later, did him a good turn, and saved
him some money.”</p>

<p>“Everybody seems to be half good and half bad,”
said Mrs. Granton with a puzzled face.</p>

<p>“Every one,” said master emphatically, “and it
goes to prove that we should all go through life with
an infinite pity for every one, including ourselves.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MASTER CARTY’S BOTTLE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Now I must hark back to Master Carty.</p>

<p>He couldn’t seem to get over his tippling for
a long time after he came to Green Hill&mdash;not until
something happened.</p>

<p>I have referred before to my conversation with
Gringo about Master Carty’s troublesome habit. The
good old dog never mentioned the tiresome young
man, till three months after that, when one day, as
he and I were taking a stroll in the young orchard to
get some of a new kind of young grass that was springing
up about the baby trees, and that was very good
for our stomachs, we saw Master Carty taking a short
cut across to the house. There was a gentle hill in
the orchard, and just as our naughty young man got
near it, out came a flask from his pocket. He was
just going to take a long pull out of it, when old
Gringo pretended to see a mouse in the earth, gave
chase, and stumbled in front of the self-indulgent young
man.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Gringo doesn’t worry about the mice.
He’s not that kind of a dog. One of my duties is to
hunt them, so they won’t hide under the snow in winter,
and girdle the fruit trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, away went the flask. I sprang to pick it up,
grabbed it, held it carefully neck down, and laid it at
Master Carty’s feet.</p>

<p>He praised me, and aimed a kick at Gringo. The
old dog stared at him thoughtfully, and didn’t say
anything, but the next day he played a fine trick on
him.</p>

<p>It was a pouring wet day, but still Mrs. Granton
and George Washington had gone over in the limousine
to spend the day with Mrs. Bonstone, Cyria and
the twins.</p>

<p>The air was so warm that they were all sitting out
on the partly covered-in veranda. The rain beat
against the glass, but Cyria and our baby were snug
inside, playing with a Noah’s ark and a box of blocks.
The two little tots sat on a rug, and the twin babies
lay asleep in a pretty swinging cot. Mrs. Bonstone
lounged in a reclining chair beside them, and my mistress
rocked and talked and knitted a sock for George
Washington.</p>

<p>I was in a corner, having an after-lunch nap. Human
beings would do well if they could imitate dogs,
and throw themselves down for a rest after eating.
Usually, they get up from the table and fly at their
work harder than ever.</p>

<p>After a while, I thought I would go up to the barn
and see what the other dogs were doing, for no one
was in sight but Amarilla, who never ventured far
from Mrs. Granton.</p>

<p>On rainy days, it was the custom for the dogs to
assemble on the barn floor to have a gossip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>I found the whole bunch up there, every one with
lip curled, and indulging in a hearty fit of dog laughter.
Even Gringo, who was not too old to enjoy a
joke, was just shaking with dog amusement. The
polite Frenchmen were giggling, while the nervous
Yeggie ran up and down, squealing and yapping with
delight. Czarina’s aristocratic lip was curled high in
enjoyment, and Weary Winnie, forgetting her laziness,
was rolling over and over in the hay ki-yiing
with glee.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott was missing; probably he was huddled
in one of the hen-houses and letting the chicken
Betsy roost on his back to keep her feet from getting
damp.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke, boys?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Let me speak, oh! let me speak,” said the dancing
Yeggie. “Mr. Carty comes home by the train, he has
to walk from the station, ’cause there’s nobody’s car
there to give him a lift. Yeggie happens to be down
there calling on a friend, Yeggie follows him home.”</p>

<p>This dog always speaks of himself by his name, instead
of using a pronoun. He is a silly little fellow,
yet lovable, and he has occasional strains of sense.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said. “I don’t see any joke yet, but go
on, and don’t jump up and down the whole time you’re
talking.”</p>

<p>Yeggie continued, “Master Carty’s rubber stuck in
the mud, Master Carty said a naughty word, and
stooped down to pull it on. Yeggie saw something
wicked in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“A flask, I suppose,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not a flask; that wasn’t big enough for to-day.
It was a bottle with strong stuff in it&mdash;Yeggie smelt it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did Yeggie do?” I asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yeggie did nothing. He just watched. Master
Carty was talking to himself. ‘If I take this brandy
in the house, those blessed’&mdash;only Yeggie didn’t hear
blessed&mdash;‘women will be watering it, and I’m wet
enough without any more diluting. I’ll hide it.’”</p>

<p>“And you marked the hiding place, and came and
told Gringo.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Yeggie did,” and the little Jack-in-the-box almost
danced his legs off.</p>

<p>“And what did you do, Gringo?” I asked, turning
to him.</p>

<p>“I thought about that kick he gave me yesterday,”
said the old dog. “A man who starts kicking animals,
winds up by kicking human beings. If I should ever
see Master Carty kick Mrs. Bonstone, or the brown
baby, I’d bite him. So I thought we’d better extract
the kick right now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this terrible,” I exclaimed. “He’s bringing
far too many bottles from the city lately. It’s amazing
how many drinks a day a man can take.”</p>

<p>“He’s a scamp,” said Gringo, “but he’ll get nothing
out of his bottle this time. I ran up here, when Yeggie
told me, and what do you think we’ve done to the
bottle?”</p>

<p>“Hidden it of course, but where?”</p>

<p>“No, not hidden it,” said Gringo, “we’ve smashed
it.”</p>

<p>“Let me finish, oh! let me finish,” squealed Yeggie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and he went on. “Master Carty didn’t hide his bottle
in the bushes the way he does sometimes. Yeggie saw
him bring it here to the barn. He climbed the ladder
to the hay-mow, he tucked it somewhere and came
down.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Gringo to me, “he wanted to have
it in some place easy to get at in this storm, and where
he could have some good excuse for calling on it. He’d
run out here to see the horses in the stable beyond,
then he’d have a swig at his old bottle.”</p>

<p>“The rogue!” I said irritably.</p>

<p>“Smell! smell! smell!” cried Yeggie, dancing up
and down, “it’s right here.”</p>

<p>I had noticed a heavy smell of brandy when I came
in the barn, and now I trotted to the other end near
the big open doors, and there on the floor, lay the remains
of a bottle on a bed of wet oats.</p>

<p>One of the men had spilt the horses’ feed, and hay
and oats were all mixed up with the nasty drink.</p>

<p>“But how did you get the bottle down from the
hay-mow?” I asked.</p>

<p>Old Czarina began to laugh, and licked the ear of
the poodle next her. “Frenchmen are clever,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>I stared at the poodles. In the days of their captivity,
they had learned how to climb ladders. They
were now never asked to perform any tricks. One
day, when we first came out here, Mrs. Bonstone had
shown a neighbour’s boy what odd things they could
do, and his mother told Mrs. Bonstone afterwards
that he went home and tried to teach his dog, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
beat him cruelly when he would not learn until she interfered
and took his stick from him.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said Mrs. Bonstone, “no more
clown tricks for our dogs. They may be as intelligent
as they please along their own lines, but they shall
not be asked to imitate human beings. They may do
it on their own initiative, if they wish.”</p>

<p>The Frenchmen, however, really liked to climb, and
Mrs. Bonstone smiled when she saw those two white
dogs going, paw over paw, up the ladders that led
to the hay-mows. The barn loft was a great place for
them to retire to when they wanted a nap.</p>

<p>The stableman, however, did not smile. One day
I heard Thomas talking severely to the two Frenchmen
who stood before him like two culprits. “If I ever
ketch you two young limbs messing up the hay for my
horses again, I’ll lather you,” he said, and he shook
a strap at them. “Horses hate to have dogs, and cats,
and any critters lying on their feed. How would you
like a horse to lie on your breakfus, hey?” and he
hung the strap up where they could see it.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen trembled, and went away with hanging
heads, and from that day to this, I had never
heard of their climbing to the mows. So I said to
Czarina, “Weren’t they afraid to go up there?”</p>

<p>“Ask them,” she said with a motion of her noble
head toward them.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen bowed politely&mdash;they always did
everything together, and each one lifting a forepaw,
curled it slightly, to signify that they had mounted to
the mow and found the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“And pushed it down?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” said all the dogs.</p>

<p>“My! what a smash it made,” cried Yeggie. “Yeggie
jumped, and then the smell&mdash;wow!” and he twisted
his muzzle all up in a knot.</p>

<p>“Brave dogs,” I exclaimed, “especially brave, since
you so hate a bottle, but weren’t you afraid Thomas
would catch you?”</p>

<p>“Yeggie watched,” cried the little dog. “If Yeggie
barked once, it meant some one was coming, and the
Frenchmen must drop on the hay, and be dead dogs.
Two barks from Yeggie meant that they had time to
skip down the ladder. But no one came.”</p>

<p>I congratulated the two poodles on their cleverness,
and asked whether the men had found the bottle.</p>

<p>“No. We found out after we’d had the trouble
of watching for them, that they’d fed the stock for the
night, and had gone to the city on a half holiday. The
chauffeur is to shut the barn doors in an hour.”</p>

<p>“Master Carty will be out before then to call on
the bottle,” I said.</p>

<p>“He’s coming, boys, he’s coming,” said Weary Winnie
suddenly. She had been staring out the barn door
in the direction of the house. We dogs all scattered,
except Yeggie who crept behind a grain measure.</p>

<p>Later on Yeggie, with wicked glee, related Master
Carty’s disappointment and anger on not finding the
bottle. He climbed to the mow, groped about in the
hay, came down, smelt his lost treasure, raged at the
men who he thought had stolen it, and flung himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
back to the house in a passion, telling what he was
going to do to be revenged on the thieves.</p>

<p>That was not the last of the bottle. The next scene
in its history came the next morning. A terrible thunderstorm
coming on at dinner time this same day, prevented
my master and mistress from taking the baby
home. They often stayed all night at the Bonstones’,
who had plenty of guest rooms.</p>

<p>Everybody was late for breakfast the next morning.
The dear human beings had sat up late talking the
night before, over the library fire that Mrs. Bonstone
had had lighted to make things look cheerful.</p>

<p>Gringo and I were the first downstairs. We ran
out-of-doors, and to our surprise, were met on the front
veranda by Czarina, Yeggie, the Frenchmen, and even
Weary Winnie, all in the most extraordinary state of
excitement.</p>

<p>“Come up to the barn,” they cried, “come up to the
barn,” and not a word more would they say.</p>

<p>We ran up like foxes, and there in front of the barn
a most peculiar thing was taking place.</p>

<p>Sir Walter stood with his aristocratic face in a snarl
of worry. He was staring at his big flock of Wyandottes
who were behaving in a most erratic manner.</p>

<p>“If those hens weren’t so steady,” I said, “I would
guess that they are trying to do a cake walk.”</p>

<p>Yeggie could keep still no longer, and just burst
out, “They’re doing the Carty walk&mdash;they got at the
bottle. Yeggie saw ’em.”</p>

<p>“What!” I barked wildly.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Gringo giving him a nip, “you’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
making Scott feel sore,” and he threw a compassionate
glance at Sir Walter.</p>

<p>“I will explain,” said Czarina in her slow, solemn
way, and she began, “You remember the oats that got
soaked with the brandy yesterday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” I replied.</p>

<p>“This morning,” she continued, “when Thomas
threw open the barn doors, Sir Walter, who had just
got the hens roused, drove them in here to get some
nice dry hayseed. They said it would have been better
for them to get out early, and pick up the fat worms
that had come up on the soil loosened by the rain.
However, Sir Walter didn’t know that. I think he
thought the wet ground would be bad for the chickens’
feet. Be that as it may, the hens obeyed him, came
in here, and he calmly watched them while they crowded
about the spilled oats. He has a good vein of Scotch
thrift, and he thought it was a good thing to save the
oats.</p>

<p>“However, they were affected immediately. You
know any kind of a bird has a short digestive tract.
When they began to stagger, he withdrew to that
spot, and he will not allow any of us to explain the
affair to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, some one’s got to put him wise about it,”
said Gringo decidedly, “and right away. I believe I’ll
do it,” and he set out in his sturdy fashion to have a
talk with Sir Walter. For a long time, they stood
with their heads close together, then Sir Walter, with
a furious face, bolted toward the house.</p>

<p>He had never liked Master Carty very much, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the young man used to tease him unmercifully, and no
dog likes persecution any more than a human being
does. I knew what he was going to do, and I whispered
to Gringo, “If I’m not greatly mistaken, we
shall soon see Mrs. Bonstone in the arena.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, as we heard later, Sir Walter burst
into the bed-room of the lady he loved so dearly, and
served so well in his devotion to her hens, and pulling
at her gown, until she hurriedly finished her dressing,
induced her to come up to the barn with him.</p>

<p>I shall never forget her face, as she stood staring
at us, at the hens, and at Thomas and Joe, who by
this time had appeared, and were yelling with glee at
the sight of the tipsy hens.</p>

<p>They quieted down when they saw Mrs. Bonstone,
and one of them beginning to sniff, followed his nose,
till he walked straight to the spot where the bottle
still lay in the midst of the few oats left.</p>

<p>“Some one’s been having a spree here,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone swooped down, caught up the broken
neck of the bottle, and despite herself, could not help
flashing him a suspicious glance.</p>

<p>“I’m a teetotaller, ma’am,” he said shortly. “Joe
and me never brings nothin’ from the city.”</p>

<p>She winced as if he had struck her. She knew she
had done wrong to suspect him, but I have noticed
that wherever drink goes, it breeds suspicion and mistrust
even in the good.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Thomas,” she said softly, and there
were tears in her eyes. “I know it wasn’t you, nor
Joe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the tears began to roll down her cheeks, and
she went swiftly back to the house. She did not like
to see her pretty hens staggering against each other,
and leaning up against the trees in the orchard, and
she knew very well who was responsible for their condition.</p>

<p>She sent her husband and Mr. Granton out, and I
thought they would kill themselves laughing at the
plight of her hens. They were powerfully ridiculous,
and to see Sir Walter trying to bunch them, and get
them into their hen-houses to hide their shame, was as
good as a play. He ran round and round them with
his tongue out, and panted for all he was worth. The
poor creatures tried to obey him, but they had little
use of their legs, and finally he flopped down on the
grass, and made up his mind just to wait till they got
over it.</p>

<p>Only Betsy was sober, and she walked curiously all
round her companions, lifting one claw high in the
air, then the other, and saying softly, “Ka! Ka!” She
was too dainty to eat oats, and had been holding herself
in, to share in Sir Walter’s nice breakfast down
at the house, as she usually did.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Walter,” said Mr. Bonstone mopping
his eyes, “let them sleep it off. Good dog,” and he
patted him.</p>

<p>I ran behind the two men as they went to the house.
I wanted to hear what they said.</p>

<p>“There’s a serious side to this, Granton,” said Mr.
Bonstone, “and my wife will be worried to death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Some one has brought forbidden fruit here. It’s between
the men and that scamp Carty.”</p>

<p>My master was very careful about meddling with his
friend’s private affairs; however he said softly, “No
tramp could pass your dogs. I believe your men are
beyond suspicion, but it’s always safe to give the suspected
person the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Bonstone briskly. “We’ll
go on the supposition that the offender is unknown.”</p>

<p>The ladies were at breakfast when we entered, and
very sweet and pretty they looked, as they sat at a
well-spread table, drawn up close to some windows
overlooking the rose-garden.</p>

<p>My dear mistress had got a little more flesh, and
I thought her quite handsome now, but she never
ceased inwardly bemoaning the fact that her beauty
had fled, though she said little about it.</p>

<p>“Let it stay fled,” Gringo often growled. “She’s
a better woman without it.”</p>

<p>“No, Rudolph, I don’t want to look at drunken hens,
or drunken anything,” she said, when my master invited
her to go up to the orchard, and see how amusing
the hens were. “Suppose George Washington
should drink when he grows up,” and she shuddered.</p>

<p>“The drink will all be banished by that time,” said
her husband good-naturedly. “You women are getting
so decided on the subject.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you men can jest,” she went on.
“I think it’s a very sad subject&mdash;a very sad one,” and
she pursed up her lips.</p>

<p>Her husband didn’t answer, but he was pleased with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
her attitude, for he gave her enough fried chicken for
two women, and usually he tried to scrimp her about
her food, for he was so afraid of the dreadful flesh
coming back.</p>

<p>I think Mr. Bonstone was in misery till breakfast
was over. He had put Carty out of his mind, and
I knew that there floated continually before his eyes
the vision of those white beauties who were no longer
mistresses of themselves. He choked once or twice
over his coffee, and finally he went off by himself in
the rose-garden, and indulged in what Sir Walter calls
a burst of Homeric laughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why he wants to laugh that way,” Sir
Walter often says to me. “It’s so underbred. I like
the way Mrs. Bonstone laughs much better.”</p>

<p>“He’s having a good time,” Gringo always growls,
if he hears this criticism, “and he’s hurting no one.
Let him alone.”</p>

<p>Master Carty came in very late for breakfast that
morning, and only the two ladies were left. He had
slept off his ill-temper over the loss of his bottle, and
was in his usual waggish, teasing mood.</p>

<p>He pulled his sister’s hair as he passed her, and
made an amusing face at Mrs. Granton.</p>

<p>His sister began to whimper a bit, and I knew a
scene was coming.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Sis?” he asked kindly. “Has
Bonstone been beating you&mdash;don’t cry in my coffee, if
he has. It will only weaken me, when I punish him.”</p>

<p>“The h-h-hens are all drunk,” she said as she passed
him his cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Drunk!” he exclaimed, “and what do they find to
get drunk on in this double-distilled temperance household?
Spring water, eh?”</p>

<p>“Some one brought this bottle to the place,” said
Mrs. Bonstone, dramatically withdrawing from under
the table the broken neck that she had picked up in
the barn.</p>

<p>Master Carty started, and said, “Ye gods! Have I
found the murderer of my long-lost brother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton chipped in here. She was hand and
glove with Mrs. Bonstone in trying to reform her old
friend Carty.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of your men have been drinking,”
she said airily, “and let some of the nasty stuff fall
on the barn floor, and the hens ate the hayseed.”</p>

<p>This was not quite correct, but it served her purpose.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” said poor Master Carty.</p>

<p>Gringo gave me a push. We were both lying on
the floor in a big patch of sunlight, apparently observing
nothing, yet taking note of all that went on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone worked herself, or seemed to work
herself into a sudden passion. “I shall ask Norman
to discharge both those men, if they are guilty. I
shall not have drunkards about the place. They might
set the barn on fire.”</p>

<p>Now this touched Master Carty in a tender spot.
He was mischievous and self-indulgent, but he was no
coward.</p>

<p>“Let me see that neck,” he said miserably.</p>

<p>His sister handed him the bit of broken bottle, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
both women surveyed him narrowly from under their
eyelids.</p>

<p>Gringo and I were close to his place at the table,
and we heard him mutter, “Well, I’ve got it in the
neck this time&mdash;like the chickens.”</p>

<p>“What are you muttering, Carty?” asked his sister.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” and he pushed his chair away
from his untasted coffee&mdash;Oh! how good it smelt, with
lots of lovely cream from the Bonstones’ own cows in
it, and a sugary sweet smell, for he liked six lumps.</p>

<p>“Stanna,” he said presently, “where’s your husband?”</p>

<p>“Gone,” she said, “some time ago. He was in a
hurry to get to town. We were late.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to tell you,” he went on with hanging
head. “Don’t blame the men. This bottle was
mine,” and he hurled the neck through the open window.
“I&mdash;I’m very sorry. I don’t see how your hens
got at it. They must have vicious tastes.”</p>

<p>Now just here, instead of falling on his neck, and
extracting from him promises of reform, as she had
done so many, oh! so many, times, his sister did what
seemed to me a queer thing, at first.</p>

<p>She put her arms on the table, dropped her head on
them, and said, “Oh! oh! oh!” a great many times.</p>

<p>Gringo had been licking his paw thoughtfully, while
he listened to the conversation at the table. Now he
stopped, and pondered. He had struck a snag in his
thoughts. He was trying to catch on to Mrs. Bonstone’s
wasping, as he told me when I whispered to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he went on licking, and I knew he had got
the clue.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I whispered.</p>

<p>“She’s going to make fun of him, poor soul!” he
responded. “She’s tried everything else.”</p>

<p>Master Carty was striding up and down the room.
“Stanna,” he said stopping short, “what’s the matter
with you? One would think you’d never seen a bottle
before.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that, brother,” she cried, lifting her head,
and beating the table with both her little hands. “It’s
the ridicule that will be made of you. Norman was
just roaring with laughter. He thought it was the
best drink joke he ever heard, and you know he is
full of them. He will tell it to the men at the club
at lunch. It will be all over the city, that Carty Resterton
has sunk so low, that he drinks with the hens.
You know what a picture Dicky Grey, and Mark
Jones and all that set will draw&mdash;Carty Resterton
having a carousal in the barn, because his sister’s house
isn’t open for that sort of thing. He took a pull at
the bottle, then the hens had their turn&mdash;oh! oh! oh!
I can’t stand it,” and she went off into an admirable
fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton threw water on her face, and rang
for Annie and they slapped and pinched her, and put
her on the sofa, and Master Carty stared and glowered,
till she recovered enough for him to ask her a
furious question, “Do you mean to say that Bonstone
is deliberately going to make game of me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton flashed out at him, “Carty Resterton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
what do you mean? Your brother-in-law is the
soul of honour, and he has had infinite patience with
your weakness. Do you suppose any one told him it
was your bottle?”</p>

<p>Master Carty rammed his hands down deep in his
pockets. Annie came in the room with a glass of
something for Mrs. Bonstone, and he had to wait till
the door closed behind her. Then he shouted, “I
wish to heaven I knew what you two women mean.”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush,” said Mrs. Granton patting Mrs. Bonstone
as if she were a child. “I will speak for you,”
and speak she did, and with an eloquence that astonished
Gringo and me, too, though I understand how
much she had developed since the baby came.</p>

<p>“She hits out from the shoulder,” muttered Gringo
admiringly.</p>

<p>Mistress gave Master Carty about the plainest talk
he’d ever had. She told him how he was killing his
poor grandmother and sister, and if she’d been in
their places, she would have turned him out to die in
the gutter.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t, you know,” I said anxiously to
Gringo.</p>

<p>“I track her,” said the good old dog. “She’s fighting
for her friend. It’ll do him good.”</p>

<p>“And your brother-in-law,” said mistress furiously.
“How many men would put up with your actions?
It’s common talk, that you come home here staggering,
night after night.”</p>

<p>The discomfited Carty at last got a word in. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
what has all this got to do with Bonstone’s going to
town and making game of me?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t gone to make fun of you,” cried mistress,
“he’ll tell the story, and your boon companions
will put their own interpretation on it. They’ll know
it was you that debauched the hens. They know you
bring bottles home.”</p>

<p>“Debauched the hens,” cried Master Carty, putting
both hands to his head, and acting as if he were trying
to lift himself up by his hair, “Good London!
have I sunk as low as that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton’s voice suddenly became compassionate.
“Run to the telephone, dear Carty,” she said,
“we can’t help loving you, in spite of your faults.
Telephone Norman, telephone my husband&mdash;beg them
to say nothing of the occurrence. Beg them to keep
quiet. Tell them it was your bottle, that your friends
will put their own construction on the story, no matter
how innocently it is told. Fly to the telephone,
like a good boy.”</p>

<p>Mistress glanced at the sofa. Her friend was with
her. She was doing right. She urged Master Carty to
the hall, she put the receiver in his hand, he called up
Mr. Bonstone and my dear master. He faltered and
stammered, and she supplied words. Finally, the campaign
was over, and he came back to the table where
Mrs. Bonstone, having revived by this time, was sitting
ringing for fresh coffee.</p>

<p>Then didn’t the two women pet him! He was their
own dear boy, no one should make fun of him, while
they could protect him. No one must tell Grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
she would be so shocked, and Master Carty
alternately beamed and glowered, and cast puzzled
glances at us, as if he didn’t quite know whether to
be flattered or disgruntled.</p>

<p>They begged him not to go in town that morning,
to take them for a drive, and presently the two women
with the children, Gringo and myself, were spinning
over the beautiful country in our big touring-car, with
Louis grinning happily as he conducted us.</p>

<p>The roads were grand after the rain, and the country
was a dream, everything being washed and clean
from the heavy rain.</p>

<p>Mistress took Carty to our house to lunch, and
Gringo says when he went home late that afternoon,
he walked up to the hen-houses and stared at the
Wyandottes for a long time, with the most curious expression
on his face.</p>

<p>Then, Gringo says, he muttered, “A companion to
hens&mdash;by Jove! I must look higher.” He sauntered
back to the house, mounted the staircase to his lovely
room overlooking the beautiful, blue garden with its
rocks and rills, and after enjoying the view from the
window for a while, got out a little book from a locked
drawer, and wrote something that Gringo heard him
read aloud, “Sworn off again, and by the hens, I mean
to keep my vow this time.”</p>

<p>He has kept it so far, though Gringo says Mrs.
Bonstone often looks at him very anxiously. That’s
the worst of tipplers. You never know when they’re
going to break out again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MRS. WAVERLEE’S SCHOOL</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Old Czarina, who came from Russia, says the
most wonderful thing to her in this Green
Hill district, is the school for children in Neighbourhood
Hall.</p>

<p>This is the building that master and Mr. Bonstone
put up on the village square. It is a big white erection
with colonial pillars and plenty of verandas, and
it has a garden round it, and a playground for little
children, and inside is a library, a restaurant, a swimming
pool, a pretty parlour where young people can
dance and play games, and a big hall where moving
pictures are given.</p>

<p>The country people just pour into it in the evening.
Every one pays five cents, and after a certain
length of time, the village will own the whole place,
for Mr. Bonstone and my master believe in public
ownership of public amusements.</p>

<p>One rule of the moving picture hall delights us
dogs greatly. No trainer of animals can ever exhibit
his creatures there. That is in the charter.</p>

<p>One good-sized room in the hall was reserved for
a school for the children of the village, and Mrs.
Waverlee is their teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>To come back to Czarina. She says that if all children
in Russia could have such a teacher as Mrs.
Waverlee, there would not be so much misery among
them. She says that in her country, great pains is
taken with the education of the children of the rich.
They are made to speak French, and if a child forgets
and addresses the mother in Russian, he or she
is made to say the sentence over again in French, and
sometimes in English, for they have governesses and
nurses of different nationalities.</p>

<p>“In this wonderful country of America,” says
Czarina, “you educate everybody. I was amazed to
see a little Russian Jewess with her arms round Mrs.
Waverlee’s neck the other day. In her own country,
the child would be kept down, and if she had a teacher,
would not dare to embrace her. Imagine the delight
of her parents, at having a rich, cultured woman like
Mrs. Waverlee devoting herself to the education of
their child.”</p>

<p>All the dogs love Mrs. Waverlee, but Gringo is her
stoutest admirer, partly on account of the English blood
in his veins, and he often runs down to her school and
calls on her, or visits her in the pretty cottage in which
she lives with Egbert.</p>

<p>She welcomes any well-behaved dog to her school,
and the other day Gringo and I sauntered down to the
village and approached Neighbourhood Hall.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, and the doors were all wide
open. We trotted across the tennis court, and the
place where the boys and girls play basket-ball, to the
garden at the back of the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a big patch of greensward there, with a
pond in the middle, where some white ducks, pets of
the children, are always paddling about.</p>

<p>The children were all out on the grass, the most of
them with bare feet.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Waverlee caught sight of us, she called
with her pretty English accent, “Good morning, dogs,
come to me.”</p>

<p>We walked toward her, Gringo with his queer sidewise
gait like that of a racking horse. He never picks
up his paws, the way a fox-terrier does.</p>

<p>“How fortunate,” exclaimed Mrs. Waverlee, as we
lay down on the grass beside her. “Our lesson this
morning is on the dog, and I had not a single dog
caller. Now, children, do these two friends of mine
suggest anything?”</p>

<p>“Tell us about bulldogs, please,” the most of them
cried. Two little girls were for fox-terriers, but they
were in the minority.</p>

<p>Some people blame Mrs. Waverlee because she
allows the children to follow their own bent so much.
One day, before the war closed, I heard her say to
a lady, “Would it not be cruel when these little creatures
come to school, bursting with questions about
affairs in Europe that they hear you older ones discussing,
for me to pin them down to a lesson in grammar,
for example? No, I find out which way their minds
lead me, and I follow it. Mornings when they want
to know how the Germans and the Allies are getting
on, I spread out a map on the grass and give them a
united geography, history and peace lesson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee shut her eyes, as she spoke. No
one knew what agony it cost her to discuss the war,
but she was not a woman to dodge her duty. She met
it squarely in the face.</p>

<p>The lady who was criticising her, said with reluctant
admiration, “My boy certainly does display an
unusual knowledge of current events, but I am conservative
in my ideas, and would like him brought up
along old lines.”</p>

<p>“Then you must take him from here,” said Mrs.
Waverlee sweetly. “The best and newest in an educational
way is what Mr. Bonstone and Mr. Granton
insist on.”</p>

<p>The lady didn’t take her son away, and a little later
I heard her gushing to Mrs. Bonstone over the school.</p>

<p>“I never heard of anything like it,” she said. “The
other day my husband brought home to dinner a distinguished
Swiss scholar. When my Frankie heard
our guest was from Switzerland, he ran to him, climbed
on his knee, and asked him the most intelligent questions
about his own country. He knew about the different
cantons, the fine system of military service, the
high mountains, the villages in the cup-like valleys, the
big hotels, the peasants, the German-Swiss and the
French-Swiss, and the coolness between them that the
war has brought to a close, and he even yodelled for
Monsieur de la Bontaine who is French-Swiss. The
man was in an ecstasy. He pressed my child to his
heart; he exclaimed, ‘Madame, I have not heard any
grown man or woman talk in so picturesque a way
about my country, since I came to America. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
marvel. When did you have him in Switzerland?’</p>

<p>“I never had him there, I told him, and at first he
could scarcely believe me. Frankie came to my assistance.
‘Mrs. Waverlee makes a country out in the
garden,’ he said. ‘We have sand, and toy trees, and
houses, and men and women, and stones, and we build
mountains and make villages and forests, and then we
go in the big hall, and see the moving pictures of it.
Oh! it is great fun.’</p>

<p>“Monsieur de la Bontaine asked permission to visit
the school, and he quite fell in love with Mrs. Waverlee.
No, I shall not take Frankie away. I am going
to give Mrs. Waverlee five hundred dollars to
spend on further equipment for the school.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone was enchanted, and told her husband
and my master how well their scheme was working
out.</p>

<p>Master sighed. He was never satisfied with what
he had done. He was always looking ahead. “Oh!
for such a school for every young child in New York,”
he said.</p>

<p>Now, to stop wandering, and go back to the day of
our call&mdash;Gringo often says, “Boy, you are an A number
one dog, but you reminisce too much”&mdash;Mrs. Waverlee
put him up on the top of a box, then didn’t she
exhaust the bulldog subject. She went away back to
the days in old England, when cruel sports flourished.
She told how men can take breeds of animals and
birds and change them. The bulldog was inbred, until
they got an animal perfectly adapted to the sport of
bull-baiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>She had some of the boys wheel out-of-doors an
almost life-sized cow that is part of the school plant.
She opened Gringo’s mouth, and the old fellow rolled
his eyes kindly, while she showed the vise-like construction
of his jaws. Then she asked him if he would
make a spring at the cow, to show the children how
the ancient bulldog used to leap at the bull’s head,
and hold on by his teeth.</p>

<p>Gringo crooked his hind legs, gave one of his cat
leaps, and landed on the cow’s upper lip. I don’t know
what that old cow was made of, but there Gringo
hung, and Mrs. Waverlee showed the children how
his lay-back nose enabled him to breathe, while he retained
his grip.</p>

<p>Bye and bye, the lip broke off, and then some of
the children cried.</p>

<p>“This is too realistic,” said Mrs. Waverlee, “but
the cow is not hurt, and the wicked sport of bull-baiting
is all over.”</p>

<p>I may say, in passing, that some people blame Mrs.
Waverlee because she does not keep everything painful
from the children.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to make them soft,” she says with
flashing eyes. “Evil and suffering are all about them.
They must have some acquaintance with them in order
to be able to overcome them. I make my own boy
sit in school beside a beautiful and innocent German
lad, to teach him to overcome his hatred for the nation.”</p>

<p>After the cow had been wheeled away, and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
broken nose hidden in a young lilac bush, Mrs. Waverlee
said, “Now, let us examine doggie’s points.”</p>

<p>I opened my eyes. I didn’t know she knew so much
about dogs. She made Gringo walk away from her,
and toward her, and she felt his back and his head, and
had him sit down and get up, and she turned over his
rose ears to show the children the pink lining, and
pinched his brisket, and lifted his feet to see if they
were sound, showed the children the set-out of the
shoulders that enabled a bulldog to crouch low between
the horns of an angry bull who tried to gore him.
Then she explained that sometimes twenty or thirty
dogs would be killed before the bull could be thrown.</p>

<p>That was news to me, and I whispered to Gringo,
“I didn’t know you actually had to throw the bull.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, “a heavy dog with a good
grip could do it easily, if he knew how.”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Waverlee penalised Gringo slightly, because
the wheel of his back wasn’t quite perfect, he
stepped off the box, and everybody went home to lunch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee invited Gringo and me to accompany
her and Egbert to their cottage, and we had a
fine lunch with Patsie, Egbert’s fox-terrier who had
been confined to the house with a sore paw. They had
a lovely little cottage, but it had a small garden only.
One day I heard Mrs. Bonstone, who has become
very intimate with Mrs. Waverlee, say to her, “Bretwalda,
you are a rich woman. Why do you not buy
a larger place than this?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” said Mrs. Waverlee indifferently.
“I have Neighbourhood Hall close by, and the river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and the meadows are open to me, and the lanes and
high-road, and the pretty winding village street. It is
all mine.”</p>

<p>“You queer creature,” said Mrs. Bonstone, but her
tone was admiring.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee glanced up at the sky with her
strange other-world look. I don’t believe anything in
this world counts much with her, except getting human
beings ready to go to the next one.</p>

<p>Shall I be there, oh! shall I be there with my dear
master? just burst from my dog-heart, one day when
I was sitting watching her as she gazed up at the sky.</p>

<p>We were all alone, and that clairvoyante, beautiful
woman understood me.</p>

<p>“Dog,” she said with exquisite gentleness, as she
laid her hand on my head, “do you think the Creator
of this marvellous universe, would ever destroy anything
utterly, in which he had placed the spark of life?
No&mdash;we shall all live again&mdash;purified, immortalised,
made perfect.”</p>

<p>I licked all the dust off her pretty feet. In her own
garden, she wore sandals and no stockings. I wished
there was something hard I could do for her&mdash;I adore
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MASTER’S BROTHER-BOYS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Living out here in the country as we do, I see a
great many poor people, either coming here to
beg, tramping by on the high road, or sitting on the
rustic benches that master has had placed all along the
sidewalks that bound his property.</p>

<p>I am amazed at the topsy-turviness of their ideas.
Now, rich people are not perfect, but on the whole,
they seem to have more common sense than the idle
poor. These shabbily dressed persons perch round on
the benches, stare at master’s big white house showing
among the trees, and these are their sentiments:
“I wish I had been born rich&mdash;I wish some one would
die, and leave me some money&mdash;I wish I didn’t have to
work”&mdash;one man only, in the whole course of my
eavesdropping under hedges, have I heard say,
“That’s a wise guy in that big house. He’s slaved for
what he got. Let him keep it.”</p>

<p>However, this kind of lazy talk does not affect master
and Mr. Bonstone. I have heard them say again
and again, that there are frightful inequalities in the
human lot, that every man does not get a living wage,
and there should be more brotherhood and sympathy
between class and class. Perhaps that is why they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
never get disgusted or offended or suspicious. Some
of the rich people about here say that they are bothered
to death with squealing, envious poor persons, who
hang round them, begging for money for this scheme
and that scheme, which has always at bottom the everlasting
endeavour to get something for nothing.</p>

<p>Master and Mr. Bonstone smile, and never worry,
nor argue, nor fuss&mdash;they just keep on helping everybody
that applies to them.</p>

<p>One day, the first summer we came out here, I was
up on the balcony outside master’s bed-room with him.
He had come home from the city very hot and tired,
and he was having a lovely time lounging in a big
chair with a glass of lemonade at his elbow.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid came up and said that a young
man wished to see him.</p>

<p>Master got up patiently, put on his coat, and went
down-stairs with me at his heels.</p>

<p>An unprepossessing looking young fellow awaited
him in the hall. He had a loose mouth, and he talked
out of one side of it, and his jaw was undershot and
one-sided, like that of a badly put together dog.</p>

<p>Master sat down on the monks’ bench beside him.
“What can I do for you, sir?”</p>

<p>The lad twisted his rag of a cap in his hands. “I
thought you might give me some money.”</p>

<p>“What do you want money for?” asked master.</p>

<p>“To get a job.”</p>

<p>Master smiled. “You don’t wish money to get a
job&mdash;you wish a job to get money.”</p>

<p>“I had work,” the fellow said with a twist of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
mouth, as if he tasted something bad, “but it didn’t
bring me in enough to keep body and soul together.”</p>

<p>“Now, what kind of a job do you want?” asked
master.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ easy that will bring in lots of coin,” he
said audaciously.</p>

<p>“Come, now&mdash;you know easy things don’t bring in
lots of coin,” said master.</p>

<p>The young fellow swept his eyes about the handsome
entrance hall, and said, “I bet you got this easy.”</p>

<p>Master shook his head, and stifled a yawn. It was
a hot day, and he does not believe in arguing. However,
he said shortly, “I did work for it.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the fellow jeeringly, “I don’t swallow
that.”</p>

<p>“Poor chap,” said master kindly, “no power of digestion.
Not your own fault, likely.”</p>

<p>“What are you givin’ me,” said the young man wonderingly.</p>

<p>Master looked him all over. I knew what he was
thinking, “Poor weak-backed, gutter-boy, fished out of
the troubled waters of New York, and sent here to be
reformed”&mdash;but it was master’s duty to undertake the
job. Likely he’d fail, but it was up to him to try.</p>

<p>“Come on, boy,” he said suddenly, clapping the lad’s
greasy shoulder. “Let’s go look for something for
you.”</p>

<p>The lad put his old weed of a cap on his head, but
master strolled out bareheaded. The sun was getting
low, and it was not as hot as it had been.</p>

<p>First he went to the gardens, and tried them on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the lad. Roses and cabbages did not appeal to him,
and he surveyed them with a dull eye. He didn’t care
to dig in the ground.</p>

<p>Master took him to the garage. No, motor-cars
did not strike his fancy, either. He hadn’t courage,
nor skill enough to manage any kind of a machine.</p>

<p>The tiny stable was the next place to visit. Here
lived Moonstone, a Shetland pony, nominally George
Washington’s, but he was too young to ride it yet, and
young Egbert had the sole use of it.</p>

<p>Neither did the pony appeal to the poor city boy.
I could have told master he didn’t care for animals,
for he had successively passed by me, Amarilla, King
Harry, and Cannie, without a word for one of us.</p>

<p>“Let’s stroll down to the village,” said master. “Perhaps
we’ll find something there.” So down we went
along the high road, then fragrant with flowering rosebushes.</p>

<p>First, there were cottages and villas standing back
from the road in gardens and on lawns. The boy
was not interested in them. When we got to the stores,
his eye brightened. Master, who was watching him
shrewdly, saw his hungry gaze go toward the grocer’s.</p>

<p>It was a store with a fine display. Behind big
windows&mdash;for the village women had a health association
and would allow no food to be displayed on the
street&mdash;were stacks of fruit and vegetables, and everything
a first-class grocer should keep. All the neighbourhood
patronised the man, and it enabled him to
keep an excellent stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would you like to stand behind a counter?” asked
master.</p>

<p>“I might,” said the lad.</p>

<p>“You think it would be an easy job?” said master
slyly. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>The lad grinned. He had some sense of humour.</p>

<p>“Mr. Washburn!” exclaimed my master, “may I
speak to you?”</p>

<p>The grocer came running from his office where he
was making up his accounts.</p>

<p>“Will you take a friend of mine for a few days’
trial?” asked master.</p>

<p>The grocer was immaculately clean, and his eye ran
over the greasy-looking boy.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to fix him up a bit,” said master.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him,” said Mr. Washburn, “on your recommendation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t work him too hard at first,” said master.
“You’re a hustler, I know.”</p>

<p>The lad opened his dull eyes, and looked so dismayed,
that the two men burst out laughing. Finally
the young fellow laughed too. He felt that he would
not be imposed on.</p>

<p>Master then took him to the village shoemaker
whose wife kept a boarding-house for young men. Here
were a number of city lads who were working in Mr.
Bonstone’s automobile school. It was now close on six
o’clock, and they were all sitting on the front veranda,
with their feet on the railing. Master introduced the
newcomer, and asked one of the lads to take him to
the dry goods store, and buy a ready-made suit, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
have it charged to him; also to take him to Neighbourhood
Hall, and introduce him, and give him a
good time.</p>

<p>The newcomer, whose name was Walt Dixon, took
everything as a matter of course. He showed neither
surprise nor gratitude. Master nodded his head
slightly to the lad who was to take him in charge. That
meant, “Watch him&mdash;find out what his morals are.
If there’s anything that would endanger village life,
let me know, and I’ll ship him elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Now all this happened some time ago, and as Gringo
says, “It’s up to Walt Dixon to make good.” But he
can’t. He’s merely a putty sort of lad. He does his
work spasmodically, he tries the grocer’s patience, he
has always to be watched and guarded. Nobody
likes him, nobody dislikes him. He’s not immoral, and
not strictly moral. He’s a kind of grown-up baby,
master says, but he’s supporting himself, and he’s out
of New York, where he loafed and lived off the earnings
of his mother and sister.</p>

<p>The only good thing about him is that he is faintly
grateful, and slightly attached to my master, and I
should not wonder if some day he would be brought
to our house to work in some capacity or other.</p>

<p>The most of master’s “brother-boys,” as he calls
them, are bright, smart lads who have gone wrong,
usually through no fault of their own, and when their
feet are set on a right track, they run like hounds
toward a definite goal.</p>

<p>They have brains. Walt Dixon is almost foolish.
Master dreads mentally defective lads and degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
ones, but he never hesitates to tackle them. Nor does
Mr. Bonstone. He had what might have been a very
serious case of a defective lad in this neighbourhood
a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>Gringo told me about it. He came over one morning
in great haste, and flopped down beside me, as I
stood on the kitchen veranda, lapping my bread and
milk breakfast.</p>

<p>“Well, old boy,” I said, “what’s up with you?”</p>

<p>“Come on out under the grapevine,” he said.</p>

<p>We walked over to a little arbour where cook sits
to prepare vegetables for dinner, and lay down in the
shade.</p>

<p>“It’s that McGrailey brat,” said Gringo.</p>

<p>The McGrailey brat is a half foolish boy, the only
son of a very respectable, Scotch-American gardener
down in the village.</p>

<p>“He tried to burn us up,” said Gringo.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! tell me about it,” I said.</p>

<p>The old boy licked his lips and began. “Last night
at twelve, I got up to lap a little water from my basin
in my boss’s bath-room. I was just saying to myself,
says I, ‘If I’m dry out here, the Bowery dogs must be
on fire,’ when <a href="#Fig_268">I heard six yelps from that imp Yeggie</a>.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“I HEARD SIX YELPS FROM THAT IMP YEGGIE”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Six yelps,” I repeated, “that means trouble in the
hen-houses.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” continued Gringo. “They were pretty sharp
yelps, so up I goes to master’s bed, and nips his foot
sticking out for coolness.”</p>

<p>“He’s always alive, so out he tumbled, and said,
‘Go ahead, pup.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“You like to have him call you pup,” I interjected.
“It makes you feel young.”</p>

<p>Gringo’s fine eyes grew soft. “It makes me hark
back to the west, and lively days when we both acted
like kids.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, Gringo?” I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Never you mind that, young dog,” he said. “I’m
as old as I look, and I look younger than I am, so let
me go on with my story. You’re an awful interrupter.
The boss and I tumbled over each other to
get to young Yeg who was waiting out on the gravel.
He pointed for the hen-houses, and there was the
grand Sir Walter sparring, dodging, pushing and barking
at foolish young Willie who had a box of matches
in his hand. The young rap had set fire to every dry
patch of grass in the orchard, and neat little blazes
were leaping up to greet us&mdash;too friendly by a long
shot.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” I said, “this is thrilling&mdash;and everything
so dry from the hot weather&mdash;what did you do?”</p>

<p>“I brushed Sir Walter and his eticut aside.”</p>

<p>“It’s etiquette, Gringo,” I reminded him.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything when I butted in,” said the old
dog stubbornly. “Little Willie struck my fancy as a
naughty bull, and I pinned him to mother earth. Mister
put his two fingers in his mouth and let a whistle
screech that brought the men and other dogs rolling
out over and over, and in two minutes they’d stamped
out the blazes.”</p>

<p>“What about Willie,” I asked.</p>

<p>Gringo burst into a hearty dog laugh. “I let him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
rise to the occasion, and he trotted to master, and held
out his box of matches, and said: ‘Little Willie couldn’t
sleep, so he thought he’d come and burn the bad weeds
out of Mr. Bonstone’s orchard, ’cause Mr. Bonstone
is a kind man to Willie.’”</p>

<p>I laughed too. “That sounds like Yeggie’s talk.”</p>

<p>“The boy has just about as much sense as Yeg,”
said Gringo. “Mister threw a bag over Sir Walter,
who was smoking and smelt to heaven, for he too had
been set on fire by the thoughtful Willie. Then he
takes Master Willie by his shirt collar&mdash;he was in
a long-tailed garment that looked as if his mother had
brought it from the old country, and down to the village,
he marches the boy.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Mr. Bonstone dress?” I inquired, in what,
I suppose, was rather a shocked voice, for Gringo said
disdainfully, “What’d he dress for? He had on a
pair of decent pajamas&mdash;best outfit for a hot night,
and no one was abroad but the moon. However, if
you must know, Thomas brought him a cloak, and he
threw it on when we went to the village.</p>

<p>“At first, Willie didn’t want to go home. You know
what a time we have to keep him off our place. Only
by telling him that we were going down to the ballroom,
which is his name for Neighbourhood Hall,
could we get him started. We trundled down to McGrailey’s
house, and mister pounded on the door.”</p>

<p>I made an exclamation of pity, and Gringo said,
“My heart was sore for them too. They’ve good
Scotch heads, and the boy’s an awful drag on their
peace of mind. They stood in the doorway after my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
boss had pounded a while&mdash;white-faced, and with eyebrows
up.</p>

<p>“Mister was cool but firm as a rock&mdash;he’s often told
them the boy would do some damage. He walked the
boy before him into the stuffy parlour, and sat down
on one side of the big family Bible, and the McGraileys
sat on the other.</p>

<p>“‘How soon can you get your lad out of this?’
asked mister in his short way.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McGrailey began to cry, and old man McGrailey
looked black.</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said the woman presently lifting her head.
‘S’pose ’twas your boy.’</p>

<p>“Father McGrailey took up the cry. ‘Yes,’ he said,
‘s’pose ’twas your boy. Would you take him out of
his warm bed, where you can look at him every night,
and send him where he’d be beaten, and driven and
scared and he&mdash;oh! great heavens&mdash;an idiot boy.’</p>

<p>“‘He isn’t an idiot,’ said mister. ‘I’ve told you
dozens of times he’s a moron. He comes first in the
class of mental defectives. Imbeciles and idiots are
below him&mdash;and he does not stay in his warm bed.’</p>

<p>“‘I couldn’t send him away,’ wailed Mrs. McGrailey
with her arms round Willie. ‘I couldn’t give him up.
He’s all I have.’</p>

<p>“‘I told you,’ said mister striking his hand on the
table, ‘that there’s a good institution up state, and I
saw boys in your Willie’s class, and their faces were
fine. They were feeding lads weaker than themselves.
He’d be taught a trade too. I’m speaking for his
good. He’s a plague to this neighbourhood.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father McGrailey looked madder. ‘I’ve heard
you, sir, a hundred times, say you didn’t believe in no
herding of people or animals together&mdash;that you
wouldn’t even bring up a pup in kennels, if you could
find a home for him.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s so,’ said my boss coolly, ‘but I make one
exception. Persons whose minds are affected cut the
very bottom out of society. They’re our criminals.
I’d doctor them. What are you doing for your boy;
come now.’</p>

<p>“The man and the woman looked at each other with
quite cunning faces. The boss had finished strong,
I was lying beside his chair, and thinks I to myself,
‘What’ll they do now?’ I knew they’d win out, for
I tell you, Boy, a pair of parents at bay is a worse
team than a pair of tigers.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Gringo, a minute,” I said. “Let me get my
wits to work. Two good citizens with a dangerous
fool of a boy have got the richest man in the community
cornered at midnight. He’s got a good heart.
They’ll overcome him, but how?&mdash;I give it up.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Gringo triumphantly, “but they
didn’t. ‘Sir,’ said McGrailey in a voice that made my
skin creep&mdash;it had the Scotch burr, and an awful agony
twisted up with it&mdash;‘may you never know the heart-scald
that we’ve known. I tell you, sir, I’ve visited the
police courts in New York&mdash;I’ve seen young men and
women that were nothing but grown-up babies judged
as if they were you or me&mdash;God pity the weak in brain&mdash;and
I vowed a vow that I’d kill my son before I’d
trust him to the stone heart of the unfeeling public!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“This was pretty stiff, and mister began to waver.</p>

<p>“The woman came back with her old cry&mdash;‘S’pose
it was your boy&mdash;s’pose it was your boy.’</p>

<p>“My boss’s face softened. I knew his thoughts ran
back to the room where young John lay in his baby
sleep, so soft, so happy, so coddled. Could anything
tear that boy from his arms?&mdash;not the whole world.</p>

<p>“‘My friends,’ he said softly, ‘I’m pleading for
your boy. You don’t understand. You’re doing him
an injustice to keep him here. There are institutions,
I tell you, where he will be treated kindly.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. McGrailey began to cry so horribly at this,
that mister said in a hurry, ‘Well, then, in the name of
common sense, suggest a way out. Your boy is not
going to run loose about this place. That’s the very
way to tear him from you.’</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Bonstone,’ said McGrailey, ‘you own two
hundred acres of wild land out Torbellon way.’</p>

<p>“Yes, mister said he did.</p>

<p>“‘Start a cottage colony, sir. Give me the post of
head gardener. I’ll build a house with my savings,
and I’ll give you the names of a score of persons like
myself who have children that are not like other children.
They’ll put some money in&mdash;but they won’t
send their boys and girls to a big institution.’</p>

<p>“‘I think you’re wrong,’ said mister shaking his
head. ‘Your boy would be better away from you&mdash;and
you’d have to hire experts to train him and others
like him.’</p>

<p>“‘Hire them,’ said McGrailey commandingly.</p>

<p>“‘Look here,’ said my boss, ‘you fellows rate my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
bank account too high. I’m sailing close to the wind
just now.’</p>

<p>“‘Trust you to raise money,’ said the man almost
contemptuously. ‘Haven’t you and Rudolph Granton
got the name for good sense in business, and wisdom
in philanthropy&mdash;ask your fellow rich men. They’d
give you funds, when they’d turn a deaf ear to the likes
of me.’</p>

<p>“My boss got up. ‘Then I’m to start a private institution
for Willie?’</p>

<p>“‘That’s it, sir,’ said McGrailey grimly. ‘You’ll
do that, and more too for a neighbour.’</p>

<p>“‘Maybe I’m a fool,’ said mister calmly, ‘but I’ll
think it over. Meanwhile, keep the boy close.’</p>

<p>“‘That we’ll do, sir,’ said the man respectfully, then
he broke down, for he was all cut up. The boy had
nearly killed him and his wife. He cried, and she
cried; and they caught the boss’s hand, and God-blessed
him; and he fled, and left his cloak with them; and he’s
coming up this evening to talk the affair over with
your boss.”</p>

<p>“Don’t those two men beat the Dutch for doing
good?” I exclaimed. “They even get up in the night
to do it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">SIR EDWARD MEDLINGTON</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">One cool, sharp afternoon, when the second summer
of our stay in the country was drawing to a
close, I found myself all alone over at Gringo’s house.
All the dogs were away somewhere, so finding no one
in the orchard to gossip with me, I made up my mind
to run down to the village and call on Mrs. Waverlee.</p>

<p>It was just about five o’clock, and she had a nice
English fashion of always having afternoon tea. When
the maid brought in the tea things, there was always
a blue bowl for Patsie’s tea, and a pink one for any
caller he might have. There was quite a nipping wind
that afternoon, and the thought of that pink bowl
nearly full of weak tea, with four lumps of sugar, and
plenty of cream in it, just warmed the cockles of my
heart, so off I trotted for the village.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee was at home sitting by the fire, and
looking very sweet and pretty but rather tired, for
she taught away a good deal of strength every morning.
Her whole soul was in her work for the children.</p>

<p>She patted me very kindly, when I ran into her
dainty drawing-room, and invited me to lie down on
the rug before the fire.</p>

<p>Then she leaned back&mdash;not in her rocking-chair, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
she hadn’t one in her house&mdash;but in a big chintz-covered
arm-chair that fairly swallowed up her slender
figure. She was gazing intently at a large oil painting
that stood in the almost loving embrace of another
big chair, placed in a good light from a window. Paper
and wrapping stuff lay on the floor, and I guessed
that the picture had just arrived.</p>

<p>While she sat staring at it, her little maid ushered
in another caller. This time it was Mr. Bonstone.
He spoke nicely to her in his short manner, said
“Hello! Boy,” to me, then stood leaning against the
mantel, watching her pour out a cup of tea for him.
As he approached the little table to take it from her,
his eye fell on the painting.</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything, but his look said, “Ah! she
has been getting a family picture from England.”</p>

<p>I have already remarked that Mrs. Waverlee was
a bit of a clairvoyante. She saw he was interested, and
she said in her distinct, delicate way, “It is my father,
taken with my boy when we were last in England.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone was slowly wiggling his spoon back
and forth in his cup to dissolve the sugar. As she
spoke, his eye kindled. Something in the portrait
aroused his attention. Then his hand stopped moving
the spoon.</p>

<p>“Your father,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repeated simply, “my dear father.”</p>

<p>Most American women would have vouchsafed some
more information, seeing that his curiosity was
aroused, but she was a regular Englishwoman, and
could talk sweetly for hours, and tell you nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, Mr. Bonstone took the initiative, and said,
“May I ask his name?”</p>

<p>“Medlington,” she said, “Sir Edward Medlington.”</p>

<p>He said nothing. He was as reticent as she was,
but both their eyes spoke. I saw there was something
underneath his interest.</p>

<p>He drank his tea, ate an English muffin, drew some
papers from his pocket, and talked over some business
with her about Neighbourhood Hall; then he took
up his hat. Before he said good-bye, he went over
and stood silently before the big picture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee began to speak. She had become
very friendly with him and his wife, and she did not
wish to appear ungracious. Then I think underneath
it all, was a feminine desire to know why he was interested
in this picture.</p>

<p>“My father was in the army,” she said, “as a young
man. During an Egyptian campaign, he lost a leg.
A change came over him during hospital life, and he
left the army and entered the church.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone looked spellbound, and murmured
something about noticing that the tall man in the painting,
holding the little boy by the hand, had on clerical
dress.</p>

<p>“My mother died when I was a baby,” Mrs. Waverlee
continued, “and my father brought me up, and
has always been very, very dear to me. I expect him
here shortly to visit me.”</p>

<p>“Your father was not an only son, was he?” asked
Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he had a younger brother who came to America.”</p>

<p>“He is not living, is he?” asked Mr. Bonstone in
an almost inaudible voice.</p>

<p>“No,” she said with a side glance at him. “He died
some years ago. We don’t know whether he left any
children.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Mr. Bonstone, and he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said calmly, but their eyes met,
and he grew a furious red.</p>

<p>“My love to Stanna,” she said, following him as he
hurried to the door. “Thank you for all your kindness
to me. If you had belonged to my own family,
you could not have been kinder.”</p>

<p>He made some sort of an inarticulate reply, and she
came back to the painting. Then she repeated Mr.
Bonstone’s questions. “Your father is not an only
son,” and “He is not living, is he?”</p>

<p>“Why negatively,” she said, “unless he knew the
answers? He is the son of my uncle who quarrelled
with his father, and ran away to America with his barmaid
wife. I feel the relationship, and I also recognise
family traits.” Her face grew a beautiful pink.
“A good man, and my own cousin. Now I am not
without relatives in this new country. Thank God! It
will be a good thing for my boy. But I must not
acknowledge this relationship, until it will be welcome
to this odd man.”</p>

<p>All this was intensely interesting to me, and I too
turned a fresh attention to the painting. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
difficult to recognise little Egbert as he had appeared
a few years ago. The tall old man was handsome
and commanding in appearance, and yet his face was
the essence of gentleness as he held the boy’s two small
hands. “Won’t Gringo be excited,” I thought, and I
was just about to whine for the door to be opened
so I could run away to him, when my dear mistress
appeared.</p>

<p>“Well, Boy, you too are here,” she said kindly
as she came in, then she began talking to Mrs. Waverlee
about the latest news, which was something that
affected me deeply and painfully.</p>

<p>“There is to be a new kind of a dog-show in New
York,” she said, “a dog-hero show. All dogs exhibited
must have done something noteworthy, or they
cannot be entered. You, Boy, are to go on account
of the service you rendered our hostess. Gringo will
be there, also King Harry and Walter Scott.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be a show for thoroughbreds alone?” asked
Mrs. Waverlee.</p>

<p>“No, breeding has nothing to do with it. It is all
inner worth&mdash;dogs who have saved persons from burning
or carried messages, or who have shown great intelligence.
In fact, I believe the mongrels will predominate.”</p>

<p>“When does it begin?” enquired Mrs. Waverlee.</p>

<p>“Next week.”</p>

<p>My heart sank within me. Oh! how I dreaded a
dog-show. When I was a young dog, I had been
exhibited several times, and every time I suffered tortures.
It was not so bad in the day time, when my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
owners were about, and everybody was watching the
men who took care of the dogs; but at night it was
terrible. All the dog-owners went home, and the men
who were left in charge, invariably drank and either
quarrelled, played cards or slept, and dogs would get
caught in their chains and nearly strangle. Oh! that
wretched drink&mdash;how much misery it causes. Then
the men would tell lies about watering and feeding us,
and many a dog suffered the tortures of hunger and
thirst. There were a few conscientious attendants, but
very few.</p>

<p>I dreaded intensely going through this again&mdash;indeed
my sufferings at a dog-show were responsible for
my wandering life, for it was after being exhibited
seven times in one spring, that I ran away from my
first home with a dog-fancier.</p>

<p>Another thing I dreaded in connection with the
forthcoming dog-show was, that everybody would find
out how valuable I was, and attention would be drawn
to me as a desirable dog to steal. Mr. Granton knew
that my points were good, but he had never chanced to
meet any one who could tell him just how good they
were. He didn’t know a very doggy set of men.</p>

<p>Well, the day came, and I was entered at the show,
and the thing itself was not half as bad as I thought
it would be. These dogs were all very much beloved
by their owners, and were not held on account of
their value as dogs, but as heroes and dog friends to
mankind. I was uneasy, for I hated being taken from
my nice home and being deprived of my liberty, but
I underwent no actual suffering. For there was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
drink there, and Louis, who was very fond of King
Harry, slept both nights the show lasted, curled up
in the straw in the big box-place our good bloodhound
occupied. So we did not suffer.</p>

<p>Gringo was furious at having to go. He hated
notoriety, and he hated being taken away from Mr.
Bonstone; and Mr. Bonstone was just as upset as he
was, but there was no help for it. The show was for
charity, and to acquaint New York with the actual
value of the dog heroes of the country&mdash;dogs who had
risked their lives to save human beings from harm.</p>

<p>The dog who took first prize was a little mongrel
who had so little thoroughbred in him, that nobody
could tell in which class of dogs his ancestors had
started. He had saved five hundred hotel guests from
death by fire. The hotel was a regular fire-trap, and
he had barked and raged when he smelt the smoke,
till he drew attention to the dreadful danger, and every
one got out while the hotel burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>Gringo got third prize. I was surprised to hear
how many events the modest old dog had been in. He
was chained next to me, and his remarks on the show
were killing. He loathed vain dogs&mdash;these fellows
who adore shows, and when the travelling boxes are
brought out, bark with excitement, and on arriving,
bask all day long in popular approval.</p>

<p>I had honourable mention. Gringo thought I would
get a prize, but when I looked round the show, I
said, “Some of these fellows here will ride rough-shod
over me. It’s amazing what a sum of fidelity to
the human race they represent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The event of the show to me was, as I had anticipated,
the finding out of my value. I was adjudged
the best dog of all breeds shown, and my value was
placed at seven thousand dollars. How I regretted
this. Coarse, sporty looking men, who bestowed not a
glance on the noble animals who had saved precious
lives, came and stood before me with their beefy faces
alight with interest. Most unfortunately, however, it
was not the sporting class that took the keenest interest
in me. Those men were rough but honest. Two
young men of the white-faced, putty-looking class that
master and Mr. Bonstone dread so much to handle,
made me tremble.</p>

<p>They did not come up and stand before me, to admire
me and ask questions. They stood a long way
off, and they got a boy to go and ask an attendant
particularly where I lived. I knew I should have
trouble with them some time in the future, and I vowed
that they would be pretty clever to catch me napping.
Both days I was at the show, they came several times
to stare at me surreptitiously, and the second day, they
brought another fellow of their own class with them.</p>

<p>I tried not to worry, and repeated to myself something
that master often murmurs when he is putting
on his shoes to go down town. “Where are the worries
I had this time last year? Gone with the snows of
winter, and the roses of summer. Therefore, why
worry over the worries of to-day?”</p>

<p>The pleasantest thing about the show was, of course,
the twice-a-day visits of our owners. The second day,
Mr. Bonstone approached our bench accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Mrs. Waverlee, Egbert and a tall old gentleman who
limped quite a bit.</p>

<p>“Wooden leg,” muttered Gringo. “It’s the boy’s
grandfather.”</p>

<p>I had told Gringo of his master’s interest in the
portrait of the old baronet. He was as keenly interested
as I was, and with me, concluded that Mrs.
Waverlee was correct. Mr. Bonstone was her cousin.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they out with it?” said the old dog&mdash;“I
hate secrets.”</p>

<p>Well, they did out with it this day. A dog-show
seemed a strange place for a recognition between a
noble Englishman and his long-lost nephew, but
stranger things than that have happened.</p>

<p>Sir Edward had arrived two days before, and Mr.
Bonstone had not seen him until he met him coming
into the show with Mrs. Waverlee and Egbert.</p>

<p>Gringo and I stared at them. “My poor boss,” said
the old dog, “his eyes are eager. He’d like to have
relatives like other folks.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Waverlee was sweetly self-possessed. No one
would have guessed that she was very much excited,
and was watching her father and Mr. Bonstone surreptitiously.</p>

<p>I have forgotten to say that Walter Scott was
chained the other side of Gringo and King Harry, and
the three grown-up persons and the boy were fondling
us alternately.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone was delighted that he would be able
to take Gringo away that evening. “Only a few hours
more, kid,” he said in a low voice as he softly rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
his hand over Gringo’s rose ears. A seal ring, his
only ornament, for he hated even a breast pin, caught
the old baronet’s eye. Now he had evidently noticed
no familiar resemblance in this man, but he could not
help recognising the ring on which was engraved the
family crest.</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything. He was a very well set-up,
self-possessed old gentleman, and very English. He
simply turned a little pale, and said, “May I look at
that ring?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone nodded, and taking it off, handed it
to him.</p>

<p>“This old man’s father was a tartar,” Gringo whispered
to me. “It’s rough on him to remember how
he and the young brother who had pluck enough to
run away were bullyragged.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone stood fondling Gringo’s head, and
looking calmly at his relative.</p>

<p>“Good blood,” muttered Gringo. “Do you notice,
Boy, that the quality don’t shriek and tear their hair
over great events. They’re quiet as the grave.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything, but I imagined the panorama
passing before the eyes of the fine-looking old man
turning the ring round and round in his hand. Having
been in England, I could call up a picture of the
old country house, the pleasant life, the gentle mother,
the domineering old father, the submission of the elder
son, the rebellion of the younger&mdash;and now the
younger son was dead, but his son lived and would slip
into the place of his father in this old man’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your Christian names?” asked Sir Edward in a
low voice as he returned the ring.</p>

<p>“Edward Norman Mannering.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward’s eyes clouded. He dropped his head
on his breast for a few seconds. His dead brother
had given his own dear brother’s name to his son.</p>

<p>Then he spoke again, “Why Bonstone?”</p>

<p>“My mother’s name,” said Mr. Bonstone shortly.</p>

<p>Sir Edward glanced at Mrs. Waverlee who had
moved away a few paces, while the two men were talking.
She smiled brightly. She understood.</p>

<p>Then he said in a low but a beautiful, affectionate
voice, “You have your father’s eyes. Give me your
arm, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “isn’t that a perfectly touching
sight, to see that dear old man going about leaning on
those two young people?”</p>

<p>Gringo spoke very gruffly. He pretended he didn’t
care, but I could see he was deeply moved.</p>

<p>“Now my kind master’s got some folks,” he said.
“There’s not a line of worry about him. We’ll see
something very fancy in his life now.”</p>

<p>And we did, for it appeared that the possession of
relatives of his own had been the one thing lacking
to round out Mr. Bonstone’s beautiful life.</p>

<p>His devotion to his uncle was superb. He was
down at Mrs. Waverlee’s constantly, and when he was
not there Sir Edward was at Green Hill.</p>

<p>There was a great excitement all over this place,
and in New York too, when it was announced that Mr.
Bonstone was related to the distinguished English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
army officer and present clergyman&mdash;Sir Edward
Medlington, and was a cousin of the aristocratic Mrs.
Waverlee. Nobody seemed jealous. Everybody was
glad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Resterton basked in reflected light. She
dragged in the title whenever she could with propriety,
and the way she mouthed the “Sir Edward” was lovely
to hear.</p>

<p>Gringo grinned whenever he heard her. “Never
before heard of two words giving a woman such satisfaction,”
he said.</p>

<p>The nice old lady’s only regret was that the title
passed to Egbert as the son of the eldest son, rather
than to Mr. Bonstone as the son of the younger.</p>

<p>I heard Mrs. Bonstone one day enlightening her.
“Grandmamma,” she said, “don’t you understand Norman
well enough to know that if he had inherited a
whole bushel of titles, he would reject them all? As
it is, he often shocks his uncle by his democratic ways.
No&mdash;Norman is a plain American. He has thrown
off his English traditions.”</p>

<p>“Sir Norman has a very pleasant sound,” said the
old lady plaintively.</p>

<p>How Mrs. Bonstone laughed. “And Lady Bonstone
or Lady Medlington,” she said&mdash;“wouldn’t that be
charming!&mdash;imagine a milkmaid and a poultry-woman
with a title. That is all I aspire to be.”</p>

<p>The dogs, too, were very fond of talking about the
baronet, and great discussions took place up in the
orchard about his title, and his artificial leg, and his
nice simple ways, and his clear manner of speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the dogs held that it was a great pity that
a baronet should have a wooden or a cork leg&mdash;we
couldn’t find out which it was, for his man-servant
never talked, and Patsie, the fox-terrier, was no gossip.</p>

<p>“Why not a baronet?” said Gringo. “He’s just
the one to afford time to go limping about.”</p>

<p>The dogs also could not understand his being a
clergyman and rector of a church.</p>

<p>“Yeggie thought he’d wear a pink coat, and go
round looking for foxes to hunt,” said the little cur,
jumping up and down, “but he never kills anything but
fish, and he bangs them on the head as soon as they’re
caught so they won’t suffer&mdash;I heard him say so the
other day.”</p>

<p>“I thought he’d get drunk every night,” said King
Harry. “I once knew an English earl down in Virginia,
and his valet had to sit up till one o’clock to
undress him.”</p>

<p>This put the old country dogs on their mettle.
Gringo, Walter Scott, and Cannie snapped at good
King Harry, and told him that the English aristocracy
were as sober as any class of people.</p>

<p>“And if our people had any faults,” added Walter
Scott, “the war has taken them all away.”</p>

<p>“Where is the nobleman to-day?” I asked one chill
November afternoon of the assembled dogs.</p>

<p>“Down the river,” said Yeggie. “I saw him going
Walt Dixon’s way.”</p>

<p>It seemed strange that there should be any connection
between this fine old English gentleman and a
poor miserable lad from New York, but there was one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
strong bond of union. They were both ardent fishermen.</p>

<p>Now last spring my master had taken great pains
to interest Walt in some form of out-door exercise.
He was so lazy that fishing was the only sport he
could be induced to undertake, but as time went on,
he became an enthusiast, and no one in the whole
country round about knew as well as he just which
fishing pools to visit to get a bite.</p>

<p>There were several small rivers near us, and Walt
knew them all. Sir Edward, finding out that Walt
would be of more use to him than any one in the neighbourhood,
cultivated him assiduously. My master
was delighted. This association was of inestimable
benefit to the boy he was trying to befriend.</p>

<p>Yeggie came dancing up to Gringo one day and
asked why the distinguished stranger was finding out
about fishing in this cold autumn weather.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know, pup?” said Gringo with a wink
at me, “that folks hang round what their mouths water
for? Give me the name of the dog that lingers long
round the kitchen windows, when the good, hot smell
of meat is wafted out.”</p>

<p>Yeggie hung his little head.</p>

<p>“The noble baronet is laying out the land for next
spring, when he’s coming back to see us all,” Gringo
continued. “He’s got to get home soon to his church.
He’s a good man&mdash;he works. Some folks and some
dogs are lazy&mdash;they don’t earn their salt.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Yeggie abruptly. “Yeggie’s going
to call on the hens,” and he diddled away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Gringo laughed heartily, as he disappeared round
the corner of the barn. “I like that little fool kid
dog,” he said.</p>

<p>“Sir Edward has been gone ever since lunch,” I remarked.
“I know, because he lunched at our house
to-day, and soon afterward went for a walk up the
Lalabee River road.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be back soon,” said Gringo, “the dark
is coming on.”</p>

<p>How well I remember that afternoon. Nobody was
anxious about Sir Edward, but in half an hour, when
it had become quite dark and he had not returned,
there was great excitement. A man with an artificial
leg who takes long walks is something of a marvel,
but he cannot go on indefinitely, and he never had
stayed out as long as this before. There was really
painful anxiety at last. I, suspecting nothing wrong,
had gone home, and was playing with George Washington
in the nursery when Bessie the nurse came in,
and called Mrs. Granton to the telephone.</p>

<p>I followed her, and heard enough to assure me that
everybody was out looking for Sir Edward, and they
had decided to ask for King Harry to trail him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton was in great trouble. “Oh! Norman,”
she said to Mr. Bonstone who was telephoning,
“there was a child lost in Torbellon this morning, and
an hour ago some men came in a car and got King
Harry to track her&mdash;Have you tried Walt Dixon?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t hear Mr. Bonstone’s reply, but I knew
by what Mrs. Granton said, he had thought the hound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
would be quicker. However, failing the hound, he
would try Walt.</p>

<p>I tore out through the front hall, and ran over to
Green Hill. On the way I met Mr. Bonstone in an
automobile hurrying down to the village for Walt.
Afterward, we all heard the story of the rescue from
Gringo who went with his master.</p>

<p>Walt told Mr. Bonstone which road Sir Edward
had taken, and the two followed it in the car, and
occasionally leaving it to plunge into the bushes by
the river bank at places Walt thought might be visited
by Sir Edward.</p>

<p>They had a lantern with them, for by this time it
was quite dark. Mr. Bonstone at last became frightfully
nervous, not outside, for he was not that kind,
but internally nervous.</p>

<p>“Walt,” he said, “think hard. I heard you talking
to Sir Edward yesterday. Did he say anything to
make you think he might take some new road you’d
never been over?”</p>

<p>Walt thought a moment; then he said, “I did tell
him of a new pool high up in the river, that no one
but me knows about. I got a dozen trout there one
early morning last spring; but he couldn’t get there
alone, I told him. It’s a rough road.”</p>

<p>“Just the one he’d try,” said Mr. Bonstone. “Jump
in, and lead me to it.”</p>

<p>This time, when they left the car, they took a rocky
path to the little river. “There’s a tiny islet in the
middle of the river,” said Walt, “with stepping stones
to it, but I guess he couldn’t make it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll wager he’s there,” Mr. Bonstone muttered.
Then he lifted up his voice, and yelled, “Hello!
Hello!” till Gringo says the woods by the river rang
with the sound.</p>

<p>Then he listened, and at once came a husky peeping
like a bird with a cold in its throat.</p>

<p>They were close to the islet, and Mr. Bonstone,
swinging the lantern for the boy behind him, skipped
over the stepping stones to it. There was a solitary
tree rooted among the rocks, and there, hanging to a
low-growing limb, was the poor baronet. His keen
angler’s instinct had caused him to mount the limb to
see if it would be a good place from which to throw
a line; his wooden leg had caught in the crook of the
limb, and there he hung, almost head down, until his
strength had been exhausted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone and Walt soon got him down, carried
him to the car, and gave him a drink from a
flask that Mrs. Bonstone had provided. Then they
rushed him to the Green Hill house which was nearer
than Mrs. Waverlee’s, and put him to bed.</p>

<p>All the family came to enquire about him. Mrs.
Waverlee was very much troubled in her quiet way,
and poor Egbert was trying hard not to cry. Master,
who was almost as upset as Sir Edward’s own family,
said to Mrs. Resterton, “Why in the name of common
sense did that old man with a wooden leg try to climb
a tree on a dark night?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Resterton was dreadfully flushed, and was
fanning herself violently. “You have just come from
town,” she said, “you don’t know that it was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
light when Sir Edward started, and you don’t understand
how crazy he is about fishing. He is always
studying those books on angling in the library.”</p>

<p>“I’m not fond of fishing,” said master, “so I don’t
share his enthusiasm, but what I do like about the
affair is the part my poor boy Walt has played.”</p>

<p>“He certainly tracked Sir Edward,” said Mrs. Resterton,
“but for him, Sir Edward might have died before
Norman found him.”</p>

<p>“She got the baronet’s title in twice that time,”
snickered Gringo who was lying beside me at Mrs.
Resterton’s feet. Then he began to pant nervously,
for the old dog’s sympathies had been aroused, and he
had tramped fast all through the woods with his
master and Walt.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said to him, “isn’t this a queer world?
Seems as if when a dog or a man does a kind deed,
he always gets his pay for it.”</p>

<p>Gringo stopped panting long enough to say, “Sure,
and it’s my wonder that when folks are so keen for
rewards, they don’t do more good. There’s big interest
on being decent.”</p>

<p>“They’ll do something handsome for Walt,” I said</p>

<p>“You bet,” returned Gringo. “His nest won’t want
for no feathers from this out.”</p>

<p>“Any feathers, Gringo,” I said gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” he growled. “You know what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish other dogs to make game of you,”
I said firmly.</p>

<p>“Bah! what’s grammar,” he said contemptuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t grammar,” I said, “it’s good English.”</p>

<p>“I’m American now,” he growled. “I’ll talk as I
like.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I replied, “I’ll never correct you again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will,” he said crossly. “You just dare to
stop correcting me.”</p>

<p>“But you resent it,” I said.</p>

<p>“You make me mad, the way you rub it in,” he
flared up. “Just correct me, and don’t gab.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help laughing, and soon the good old
fellow joined me. “Gringo,” I said, “we’re good
friends&mdash;always and forever.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” he said.</p>

<p>I was going to correct him, then I reflected that
“You bet” though slangy is decidedly English, and I
ran away home after my master, who went to take the
good news of Sir Edward’s return to his wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOY MONTMORENCY</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">A few days after Sir Edward’s adventure, and
when he was quite restored to health, and ready
for more experiences (for he was a most daring,
plucky old man) there was a strange arrival in our
home.</p>

<p>I had been to New York with my dear mistress.
She wished to call on some friends on Riverside Drive
and had invited me to go with Amarilla, for she knew
I loved motoring. Fortunately it was not a very
cold day, and she took the touring car. I detested the
limousine. She was all wrapped up in a big cloak,
and Amarilla sat on her lap and kept her warm. I
thought that of all the ladies we passed in handsome
automobiles, not one had such a dear face as my own
mistress. I sat on the seat beside her, and she tucked
the rug all round my neck to keep me comfortable.</p>

<p>Well, we had a very pleasant afternoon in the city.
Amarilla and I did not go into any of the houses,
but one lady sent us out some sweet cakes which were
very acceptable, for the cool air had, sharpened our
appetites.</p>

<p>“Amarilla,” I whispered in the little dog’s ear,
“where is the charm of the Drive, of Fifth Avenue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of Broadway? Gone&mdash;gone, except as lovely, lively
places to visit. No more New York for me.”</p>

<p>Amarilla trembled, and nestled closer against Mrs.
Granton. She had always hated a city. How her
little face brightened when we were well on the broad
road leading to Pleasant River. How much we both
loved that big house, and the dear people who lived
in it.</p>

<p>“Amarilla,” I said, “if our family moved back to
New York, would you come too?”</p>

<p>She gave a pitiful little squeal, but it was a decided
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they lost their money, and had to live
down town, would you stick to them?”</p>

<p>At this she struggled to her feet, wagged her bushy
little tail, and barked sharply.</p>

<p>“Hush, Boy,” said our mistress, tucking her up
again. “You are exciting Amarilla.”</p>

<p>I persisted and whispered again, “Suppose your
missie (that was what she always called Mrs. Granton)
was poor, and had nothing to eat: would you
go on the stage again, to earn some money for her?”</p>

<p>Amarilla hesitated one instant, then she began to
howl very gently, very resignedly, but with great determination.
She would be willing to make any sacrifices
for the woman who had been so good to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granton was annoyed with me. She knew
that we dogs communicated with each other. “Boy,”
she said irritably, “if you make Amarilla uncomfortable
once more, you shall go in with Louis.”</p>

<p>This quieted me. I cuddled up to her, wiggled my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
body by way of apology, and did not say another word
till we got home.</p>

<p>I am a great talker, and often keep on when I
know I should stop. When Gringo first knew me,
he called me “The Wandering Dog” because I had
travelled so much, but after a time he called me “The
Wandering Dog” because I told so many stories that
hinged on each other.</p>

<p>When the car pulled up in our own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte cochère</i>
I followed Amarilla as she ran after her dear missie
to the library. Such a big fire leaped in the chimney,
and before it stood master with George Washington
all dressed up in his white velvet dinner clothes, for
he was allowed to come to the table and sit in a high
chair with toys before him. He got nothing to eat,
of course. He had had his bread and butter supper
at five.</p>

<p>Well, in addition to George Washington, there
stood on the rug a boy about a year older than George,
and master’s face as he surveyed him was a study.</p>

<p>He was a kind of a caricature of a petted darling.
I understood at once that he was a poor child, masquerading
as a rich one. I know the poor smell.
Somebody had taken great pains with his toilet. He
had on a little plush cap with a gilt tassel, his coat
was green with gold buttons, his shoes were a pale
blue, his little hands were dirty, but his gloves sticking
out from his tiny pocket, were quite clean. That
was so like poor people&mdash;to have clean gloves and
dirty hands. He seemed to have no handkerchief,
and was sniffing violently at intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Master was grinning. “Read this, Claudia,” he
said, handing a slip of paper to mistress who had
sunk into a chair, and was examining the child with
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Granton and Lady,” she read aloud, “Dear
Friends, raise the boy as your own&mdash;he is good blood.
His name is Montmorency.”</p>

<p>Mistress looked amazed. “Where did he come
from?” she asked.</p>

<p>Master shook his head. “I don’t know. Bessie
says when she was bringing our boy in a short time
ago, this child came strolling up the avenue toward
them, clutching this piece of paper in his hand. Bessie
read it, then ran down the avenue as fast as she could,
but there was no one there.”</p>

<p>“Little boy,” said mistress, “where do you come
from?”</p>

<p>He turned his small, pale, rather intelligent face
toward her, and said something that sounded like
“Gnorrish!”</p>

<p>Mistress looked despairingly at her husband. “What
is your mother’s name?” she asked.</p>

<p>This time he uttered a single syllable that sounded
like “Granch!”</p>

<p>“Da, Da, Da has come home,” interrupted little
George gleefully.</p>

<p>“Why, he doesn’t speak as well as our baby,” said
mistress. “What shall we do about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s a present, evidently,” said master.</p>

<p>“George, come here,” said mistress, and she took
her own child on her lap. Then she went on. “We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
don’t know what sort of a place he’s come from.”</p>

<p>Master pressed the electric button beside the mantel,
said something in French to mistress, and when the
parlour-maid came she received instructions to take
the little stranger away, have him thoroughly washed,
his head included, his clothes folded up and put away,
and other ones put on him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the mystery is about him,” said
master. “Why should any one try to foist a child on
us anonymously, when we are so ready to help any
one? I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“I understand it,” said mistress softly, and as she
spoke she stroked George’s fair head. “It’s some
poor creature who cannot provide for her child. She
looks at our child with envious eyes. She thinks if
she gives up her boy, we may do for him what Stanna
has done for Cyria.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that is the explanation?” said master.
“But in Stanna’s case everything was open and above
board. I don’t like this mystery, and I don’t care to
be dictated to with regard to the size of my family.”</p>

<p>“Let’s find out the mother,” said mistress. “It will
probably be an easy matter.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t an easy matter. Master put several detectives
on the case, but the affair had been arranged
by some unknown person with infinite skill, and they
could not find out one thing about it. No one thought
of appealing to me, though I had guessed immediately
where the boy came from.</p>

<p>Master of course thought of King Harry; but he
was useless, for the child’s tracks led right to the station,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the station meant New York city, and the
hound would be of no use there. He had found the
lost child in the country that he had been searching
for when Sir Edward was missing, but a city with its
multitude of tracks bewilders any bloodhound.</p>

<p>The evening the child arrived, there had been about
him a strong smell of a place I did not know, but
also a faint suggestion of a place I did know, especially
about his face, his hands, and the piece of paper
he carried, and that place was the Blue-Bird Laundry.</p>

<p>We dogs have every person, every locality, listed in
our world of smell. I had been to the laundry several
times with my master, and the mingled odour of soap-suds,
cooking, and the personal scent of the women
there, could not be mistaken by me.</p>

<p>These detectives that master employed had no
highly developed sense of smell. They were following
trails suggested by their eyes and ears.</p>

<p>Master was a long time figuring out my interest in
the child, but finally it dawned upon him.</p>

<p>I was always sniffing about the little stranger, for
I wanted to help my dear mistress. She was such a
good mother, and I hated to see her troubled. Her
loving heart, so warm toward all mothers, since she
had had a child of her own, had prompted her to
take young Montmorency right into her own nursery,
but she did not enjoy doing so.</p>

<p>One day when I was following her about the house,
she came suddenly into the nursery, and stopped short,
gazing at the two children.</p>

<p>There stood Montmorency, dressed in a dainty suit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of pale blue, uttering a succession of queer, uncouth
sounds which all seemed to begin with “G,” and teaching
a vulgar little trick to her beloved George. The
trick wasn’t very bad, but George was so much cleverer
than Montmorency that he added some details
of his own, that made me grin, but which brought a
frown to her face.</p>

<p>She caught George to her, and sat staring at the
little stranger. After a while, master strolled into
the nursery.</p>

<p>“That child belongs most decidedly to a different
stratum in society,” she exclaimed, “a much lower
one,” and she told him about the trick, which was a
spitting one.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right, Claudia,” said master
thoughtfully, and he too stared and stared at young
Montmorency, who was polishing off his funny little
nose on his clean tunic.</p>

<p>I ran toward master, and pushed my paw against
his knee&mdash;a habit I have when I wish to attract his
attention, or have a conversation with him. Of
course, this is not good manners for a well-trained
dog. All dogs should keep their paws on the ground
where they belong, but I was allowed this liberty by
my kind master, and I took care never to abuse it.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter!” he cried, which is the nearest he
ever comes to a swear-word. “I believe Boy has
nosed out something about that child. Claudia, please
keep George quiet for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Master fixed a steady gaze on me, and I stared full
into his eyes. We were concentrating. “Boy,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
said at last, “that child comes from New York, doesn’t
he?”</p>

<p>I barked once, sharp and clear.</p>

<p>“You smell a New York smell on him?” said
master.</p>

<p>I barked twice. “Yes, sir,” that meant, “I certainly
do.”</p>

<p>“Riverside Drive smell?” asked master.</p>

<p>I looked disappointed, and turned my head away.</p>

<p>“Smell of Ellen’s home?” pursued master.</p>

<p>No, this child had never been near Ellen, so I
said nothing.</p>

<p>“No up-town suggestion,” said master. “Down
town, then?”</p>

<p>I was tremendously excited. I was leading him on.
I barked wildly, and danced about the room.</p>

<p>“Getting warmer,” said master, who was becoming
excited too. “Now, where have we been down town
together? In my office, Boy?”</p>

<p>No, no, he was on the wrong track, and my face
fell.</p>

<p>“No office clue,” he went on. “French café, then&mdash;perhaps
a waiter’s child.”</p>

<p>Wrong, wrong, and I said nothing.</p>

<p>“The settlement house, or the day nursery?”</p>

<p>No, no, poor master&mdash;why could he not guess. He
mentioned ever so many places down town that we
had visited together, and he was so slow at getting
to the right spot, that I, in despair, lay down on the
floor, put my nose between my paws, and pretended
to go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“He finds you very stupid, my poor Rudolph,” said
mistress slyly. She loves to tease him occasionally,
and she was following his questions and my answers
with intense interest.</p>

<p>“Let me make a suggestion,” she said at last. “There
is one place you never used to visit, but that you go
to quite frequently now&mdash;Is it the Blue-Bird Laundry,
Boy?”</p>

<p>I barked, I screamed with excitement, I ran to her,
and licked her slippers and her hands. Oh! the clever
woman.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter,” said master again, “this looks like
magic. Now, let us find the woman. Is it Perky Moll,
Boy?”</p>

<p>The matron in the laundry is a lady who is the
widow of a former friend of the Grantons. She is
full of fun, and has nick-names for the girls which she
uses sometimes with master, but which the girls themselves
never hear.</p>

<p>Well, it wasn’t Perky Moll, and my excitement
passed away, and I looked cast down.</p>

<p>“Is it Jumping Jenny, Troublesome Doll, Mrs. Willie
Nillie?” and on master went, over a long list. At
last he had mentioned every woman in the laundry
except the right one. (And just here, I may wander
long enough to say that the dreadful woman with the
child that we met one night on Riverside Drive was
not there. She had died, and her child was in the country
with a farmer’s wife.)</p>

<p>Now at this point, when master was puzzled, my
clever mistress interposed again. She had a scent as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
keen as old King Harry’s, about matters where women
and children were concerned.</p>

<p>“Is it old Jane, the cook, Boy?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>Now I was in an ecstasy. I couldn’t stop to lick
any one. I yelled with glee, and tore round and round
the nursery.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” said master slowly, when at last
I pulled up. “Boy has jumped at the Jane suggestion&mdash;but
she is too old to have a child. Maybe it’s
her grandchild.”</p>

<p>Mistress didn’t say anything, and he went on affectionately,
“My clever little dog&mdash;my clever brother-dog.
You are worth your weight in gold.”</p>

<p>This made me feel and act foolish and modest, and
I calmed down, and went to lie at his feet.</p>

<p>“Old Jane,” he repeated soberly. “Poor old Jane&mdash;what’s
the matter, Claudia?”</p>

<p>Mistress was crying softly, but at his question she
flared up. “Can’t you see?” she said wildly, “oh!
can’t you see, you obtuse man? That nightmare of
a woman&mdash;she has no teeth&mdash;her eyes are all red&mdash;she
looks clean, but so thin and starved&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She is a cook,” said master.</p>

<p>“She has nearly killed herself working for her
child,” said mistress. “I remember the dreadful hunger
in her eyes one day when you took me to the laundry.
She stared at me in the kitchen; she slipped
upstairs, and watched me from a doorway. She tore
the child from her arms to give me to bring up&mdash;oh!
poor soul, and cruel, cruel society to so wound a
mother heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“We pay her well,” said master.</p>

<p>“But the money has gone to her child. She has
been boarding it somewhere. Oh! Rudolph, go buy
her some teeth.”</p>

<p>Mistress laughed and cried in the same breath, and
finally she had to go and lie down. She kept on chattering
hysterically about the woman who went without
teeth to buy clothes for her child, until master became
quite anxious.</p>

<p>“You are making a mountain out of a molehill,
Claudia,” he said. “I cannot think that your suspicions
are correct.”</p>

<p>“They’re not suspicions,” she said excitedly,
“they’re verities. Go to town&mdash;you’ll see.”</p>

<p>Master thought he was done with New York for the
day, but after dinner he had to post off to the laundry,
where he found that everything mistress had said was
correct.</p>

<p>Poor old Jane was not half as old as she looked.
She acknowledged that no one in the laundry knew
that she had a child; that she had been boarding him
ever since he was a baby; that she wanted him to be
brought up a gentleman; that she had sneaked him out
to Pleasant River, taking infinite precautions not to
be discovered; and that she had actually spent nearly
every cent of her wages on this beloved child.</p>

<p>I went to town with master, and I shall never
forget the sight of that poor, thin woman as she sat
in the matron’s office answering master’s questions.
Her indifference, almost stupidity about her own welfare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
her quick mother-wit and shrewdness about her
child, excited my most intense admiration.</p>

<p>When master finished questioning her, he said,
“Jane, I have a plan to propose. I hope you will
agree to it. You should have left here long ago, but
we kept you because you begged to stay. Now you
will remain in New York, only long enough to get a
set of teeth.”</p>

<p>Here he stopped and smiled a very pained sort of
smile, and looked hastily from the nice plump matron
whose big blue eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“After you get your teeth,” he went on, “you will
come to Pleasant River. I have a cottage to let there,
you shall have it, and Montmorency may live with
you. Your skill in cooking will support you. I will
see to that.”</p>

<p>Jane began to mope in a dull sort of way. She
did not cry. Her red eyes looked as if she had shed
all the tears she had to shed. She said she would
rather his wife would keep Montmorency, and she
would stay in New York.</p>

<p>“That I cannot consent to,” said master, and he
got up to show his decision was final.</p>

<p>Jane wasn’t a bit grateful. Her mania for her
boy’s advancement socially made her fight against
coming to the country, and kick hard at living in the
pretty cottage master fitted up for her. Master and
mistress paid no attention to her tempers. They went
on, and coaxed and petted her, till finally she began
to get her health back, and then she became more reasonable.
All this happened a few months ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
now she is the leading caterer of the countryside, and
is a comfortable, decent mother, bringing up her
idolised boy in a very sensible way. He goes to Mrs.
Waverlee’s school, and I think will make a very decent
man.</p>

<p>Jane never gushes to the two persons who have so
befriended her, but I heard her one day tell the woman
next door to her that she would walk over red-hot
kitchen stoves if it would benefit Mr. and Mrs.
Granton.</p>

<p>I seldom hear any one thank master for anything he
does, but it makes no difference to him. He just
keeps on doing good, thanks or no thanks.</p>

<p>I may say in closing Jane’s story, that she got the
finest set of artificial teeth that New York could afford,
and for a while the dentist had her wear things called
“plumpers” to make her thin cheeks stick out. Now
I hear from Montmorency’s dog, who is one of Weary
Winnie’s pups, that Jane threw the plumpers in the
trash can, and we can all see that she is visibly better,
and has some colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>The tailor’s dog, Beauty Beagle, says that her master
is getting sweet on Jane, because she is such a
good cook.</p>

<p>The tailor is a cute little man, about as fat as
a lead pencil, and not much to look at, but he has a
good heart and would make a fine step-father for the
redoubtable Montmorency who is learning to talk
quite well.</p>

<p>Beside that, he has true views of life. One evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
when I was passing by Jane’s cottage, I heard him say
to her, “You ain’t on the right track.”</p>

<p>I stopped to listen, for I am interested in Jane.</p>

<p>“Yes I be,” she said. “I want my boy to be a
good dresser.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t the outside alone that counts, Jane,” said
the tailor. “It’s the inside, too.”</p>

<p>“And you a tailor,” she said contemptuously.</p>

<p>The little tailor was pretty decided, and he went
on, “You can make Montmorency a gentleman as well
as Mr. Granton can.”</p>

<p>“Now, tell me how,” she said anxiously.</p>

<p>“Learn him to be meek,” said the tailor, “learn him
to act like a man, learn him to be bossed so he can
boss&mdash;to treat very merciful any poor folk and dumb
critters that are under him, to be clean inside and out,
to get a first-class education, and to wear a tidy suit
of clothes.”</p>

<p>Jane didn’t say anything for a long time, then she
remarked, “That’s like a pictur of Mr. Granton. If
my boy could be like him, I’d be suited.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MOST PAINFUL EVENT OF MY LIFE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Three weeks ago, I was just about to bring this
partial story of my life to a close, when something
very tragic, yet not altogether unexpected, happened
to me.</p>

<p>It began with a lie. I was sitting one sharp, cool
afternoon all alone up in the Bonstone orchard, thinking
what pleasant homes Gringo and I had, and how
few worries we experienced&mdash;a dangerous thing for
dog or man to do, for something is sure to happen&mdash;when
<a href="#Fig_310">Reddy O’Mare came trotting round the corner
of the barn</a>.</p>

<p>Reddy is a bright-red, cocky Irish-American terrier
who lives on the next place to the Bonstones&mdash;a magnificent
estate called Greenlands.</p>

<p>“Hello! Boy,” he said gaily.</p>

<p>“Hello!” I said soberly. “This is the second time
you’ve been here to-day.”</p>

<p>“Twice for me, means twice for you,” he said, in
his impudent way.</p>

<p>“Look here, Reddy,” I said, “I’m Gringo’s best
friend. He doesn’t like you, and he’s laying for you.
He says if you come over here once more and sneak
Weary Winnie over to Greenlands, he’ll wallop you.”</p>

<div id="Fig_310" class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">
<img src="images/p312.jpg" width="581" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">REDDY O’MARE CAME TROTTING ROUND THE
CORNER OF THE BARN</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Reddy laughed. “Gringo’s an old fool,” he said
gaily. “Sure Winnie likes a frolic with a dog her own
age.”</p>

<p>“She has dogs of her own age here in her own
home,” I said.</p>

<p>“But all the dog-world likes to wander,” he said
with a wink, for he knew the story of my career.</p>

<p>I smiled. I couldn’t help it. He is so merry, so
full of tricks. However, I thought it my duty to
warn him again. “Look out for Gringo,” I said.</p>

<p>“Gringo is an old soldier dog,” he said, “he bosses
too much.”</p>

<p>This was true, but Gringo is my best friend always
and forevermore, and I was not going to discuss
him with this care-free wag.</p>

<p>“Sure you ought to pity me,” he said, “shut up in
that big house with forty thousand servants, but never
a dog to play with.”</p>

<p>“I do pity you, Reddy,” I said. “I think it is very
hard for your master to go to the city, and leave you
all alone with the servants who don’t pet you. You
know you are always welcome in our home.”</p>

<p>“But it’s the forbidden game I always want to play,”
he said, with a spring in the air at a passing fly.</p>

<p>“Here comes Gringo,” I said, looking toward the
house.</p>

<p>“Let him come,” said Reddy, who was no coward,
and he flopped down on the grass.</p>

<p>The old dog came sagging along. Weary Winnie
was some paces behind him, and when she saw Reddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
she dashed ahead, crouched to the ground, and got all
ready for a frolic with him.</p>

<p>Gringo went right up to Reddy. “Stand up,” he
said.</p>

<p>Reddy stood up, and Gringo took him by the
throat.</p>

<p>I thought he would kill him. I was first in terror,
then in agony. Reddy was very valuable, and if he
were killed by one of the Bonstone dogs, it would
make bad blood between Greenlands and Green Hill.
I was also irritated with Gringo. He was too severe
with the young dogs.</p>

<p>I ran up and down. Would no one come? Not a
soul was in sight. I galloped toward the house, then
I had a sudden thought, and ran back.</p>

<p>Gringo still had Reddy pinned to the earth in that
awful silence. “Gringo,” I whispered, after I had
leaped close to his ear, “your boss is having a fit in
the dining-room.”</p>

<p>Gringo never uttered a sound. He just let go, and
raced to the house. His private vengeance was thrown
to the wind, when it was a question of his dear master.</p>

<p>“Skedaddle, Reddy,” I said as he floundered to his
feet, and staggered against Weary Winnie who had
sat watching the attack in her quiet bull-doggy way.</p>

<p>Reddy skedaddled, and this time Winnie did not
go with him.</p>

<p>I might have skedaddled too, but something told me
I should not mend matters by doing this. I had better
stand my ground.</p>

<p>Presently Gringo came waddling back from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
house. He was in a most furious bulldog rage. I
had told him a lie, and he was telling himself that
he had been a fool to believe me. Mr. Bonstone was
never in the dining-room at this time of day.</p>

<p>Beside that, I had given him an awful fright, and
he was no longer quite young.</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “I thought you were going to
kill that dog.”</p>

<p>He said never a word, but I knew what he was
thinking&mdash;couldn’t I trust him to know better than to
kill a neighbour’s dog? He was merely punishing
him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand it,” I went on, “I was thinking
of your reputation.”</p>

<p>Still he didn’t answer me, and I got angry. “You
are too cross with the young dogs,” I said. “Everybody
says so.”</p>

<p>This cut him to the quick, and he gave me an awful
look. Then, for his anger was still burning in him,
he had to give me a dig. “I’ll never trust you again,”
he said.</p>

<p>Now I was in a rage. I had done the thing for
the best. I was trying to keep peace, and preserve the
good name of our circle of dogs.</p>

<p>“You are wilfully misunderstanding me,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“A lie is a lie,” he said, with a sullen fire in his
dark eyes. “You never lied before.”</p>

<p>“And I never will again,” I yelped at him, “unless
I see you trying to kill some one.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t trying to kill him,” he retorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“You looked like it,” I said, and we went on arguing
and abusing each other for half an hour. We
finally got down to the question, is it right to lie
under any circumstances? All the dogs heard us yapping
and snarling at each other, and they came running,
and took a tongue in the argument. They were
tremendously excited. A row between two old friends
like Gringo and myself was a most startling event
in our dog circle.</p>

<p>Some were for lies, some against. Yeggie said a
lie was a mighty convenient thing when a dog got in
a corner. Sir Walter Scott said it was underbred to
lie. Czarina said to lie with discretion was diplomatic.
Weary Winnie said she’d rather lie than speak the
truth, whereupon she got a nip from Gringo, and was
sent to bed.</p>

<p>Finally Gringo turned to me in a passion, and said,
“Get home with you&mdash;you make yourself cheap coming
here so much.”</p>

<p>Imagine my feelings&mdash;I am a dog of spirit, and I
raced out of that orchard pretty quick. Gringo and
I had never had words before, and I was so broken-hearted
that I yelped with pain as I ran home.</p>

<p>Now, being so taken up with myself, and listening
to the animated barks behind me, for every dog was
remonstrating with Gringo for his severity toward me,
I did not notice properly the way I was going.</p>

<p>Usually, I am what is called an alert dog. I observe
what is before, and behind, and all round me,
and ever since the dog-show, I had been more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
ever on the watch, for I remembered the evil looks
of the two youths who had stared at me.</p>

<p>This afternoon I forgot them. I had told a lie and
lost a friend, and this melancholy happening chased
everything else out of my mind. So I ran blindly,
and evil fell upon me.</p>

<p>I was on what we called the rock walk, a long lane
between our property and the Bonstones’. Thick-growing
alders were each side of it, and I leaped
from stone to stone, and ran occasionally along grassy
places, till I was near the Osage orange hedge that
surrounded our rose-garden.</p>

<p>If I had been on my guard, I would have sensed
the presence of strangers, and would have noticed a
rustling in the bushes. As it was, I pulled up too
late.</p>

<p>Something had just said to me, “Danger ahead,
Boy: stop short, and go back.”</p>

<p>I whirled in my tracks, but it was too late. A
stranger had stepped out of the bushes, a rope had
curled through the air&mdash;I was lassoed for the first
time in my life.</p>

<p>Half-choking, I was hurled to the ground. Something
gave me a whack on the head, and I was stunned.
Only partly, for I have been stolen several times, and
I pretended to be more unconscious than I was.</p>

<p>I knew better than to cry out. I just saw that the
two men bending over me were not the ones who
had been at the dog-show. They were too clever to
come here themselves. These were older men. I
knew I was being carried to a motor car, that I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
put in a box and run under the seat, and that we sped
toward New York.</p>

<p>I was terribly unhappy, of course, but not despairing.
No one had been able to keep me in a place
that I wanted to get out of. I came to myself fully
after a bit, and lay still and watched events.</p>

<p>These fellows were pretending to be electric light
or telephone men. Quite often, when other automobiles
were passing, they got out, and tapped poles in
a knowing way. They wore big leather belts, and they
dragged about ropes and coils of wire. I could look
out of a crack in the box, and I heard sounds that I
pieced together.</p>

<p>I did not know by which road we were going toward
the city, but something told me after the lapse of an
hour or two, that we were in the Mount Vernon or
Pelham Manor district.</p>

<p>I lay low, and went on saying nothing; and after a
time I felt the car stop, and my box was taken up and
carried into some kind of a shed, a door was banged
together, the box was opened, and four young men
faces confronted me.</p>

<p>Two of them were the ones I had noticed at the
dog-show. They had paid, or were going to pay, the
others for stealing me. I was ordered to get out, and
in a way that was not too feeble, nor too lively, I
crawled out on the earth floor.</p>

<p>They had stolen me to sell. I knew that, and I
knew also this was not the time to see about escaping.
I was really exhausted, for mental worry is as fatiguing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to animals as to human beings, and I just dropped
down on a heap of straw.</p>

<p>“Ain’t much to look at,” said one of the men who
had stolen me.</p>

<p>“It’s points,” said one of the white-faced youths.
“I don’t understand the gab about it, but he’s worth
seven thousand all right.”</p>

<p>Their talk was dreadful&mdash;all tarnished with oaths
and strange slang that of course I shall translate, for
it is not fit to repeat.</p>

<p>Poor fools&mdash;poor young fools, I thought as I
looked at them. If master could only get at you&mdash;but
you belong to the class he dreads, that pale-faced,
anemic lot without morals, and with absolutely nothing
to work on. It seems as if ill-health, and crowding
and poverty, make a criminal class that is the most
desperate, for you can’t do much with it. These two
poor wretches should have been locked up and carefully
watched. All the time I was with them I did
not hear one decent word uttered by them, I did not
see one decent action performed. They were rotten
through and through.</p>

<p>I tried not to be revengeful as I listened to them.
The two fellows who had stolen me were more decent
than the two others. They were clamouring for their
money, but they were assured none would be forthcoming
till I was sold. They detailed with disgusting
glee how they had hung about Pleasant River all
day, pretending to be telephone men.</p>

<p>“He’s cute,” they said in describing me. “He gives
strangers a wide berth. We most got him twice, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
he veered off and ran down the road, not minding us
in particular, but just ’cause he’s cute.”</p>

<p>I groaned inwardly. I remembered these two fellows
who had even had the audacity to come up near
the house and examine our poles.</p>

<p>Finally they went away, and my two jockeys went
to a rough table in the corner of the shed, took up a
black bottle and shook it.</p>

<p>I had no fear of their injuring me. I was too valuable
for that. In a minute, it flashed upon me what they
were going to do. I was to be dyed.</p>

<p>I smiled sardonically. My dear master would raise
heaven and earth to find me. A little dye would not
turn him off the track. I hoped they would be careful
about my eyes, and they were, for one man rebuked
the other sharply, for letting the brush come too near
an eyelid. Nothing was to be done to me that would
take anything off my market value.</p>

<p>I felt like a fool though, as they set me on the
rough table and went all over my hair with a brush.
How the other dogs would laugh if they saw me.
A white wire-haired fox-terrier has some style&mdash;an
all black one, none whatever.</p>

<p>However, I just made up my mind to submit. There
was absolutely no use in worrying, and for to-night,
I need not fatigue my brain by thoughts of escape.
When I had been stolen before, I had learned to take
my capture easily, till my captors were off their guard
which they never were at first. I must wait some
days.</p>

<p>One thing I had done before when trapped, was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
pretend to like my captors. That rôle would not take
here. These two fellows had no more comprehension
of the dog world than if they had been wooden men.
They loved no one, feared no one; they seemed to
hate everybody, even each other. It was of no use
to try to cajole them, so I just pretended to submit,
without looking too happy or appearing to be ill,
for then they would have dosed me.</p>

<p>So I let them dye me and tie me, or rather chain me
to a stout iron bar run down into the earth. They
pried off my collar, made a hole in the ground, and
buried it, and put a new, very strong metal one on
me. They acted as if they knew I was a dog with
brains, but I fancy their motive was simply one inspired
by native cunning and skill in stealing. They
must take every precaution to ensure the success of
their scheme.</p>

<p>Well, at last I was free to lie down on my bed of
straw. One of them stayed with me while the other
went into the shabby house attached to the shed and
brought me out a plate of meat. Then they set a
pan of water beside me and went into the house, leaving
the door open. I could not make a movement without
their hearing me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">WEARY DAYS AND A RESCUE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">There is no use in recounting the weary days
and nights that passed. I soon figured out the
whole story. These two scamps, after finding out my
value at the dog-show, had set enquiries on foot in
the underworld, and had found out that there was a
demand for wire-haired fox-terriers on the Pacific
Coast. If they could ship me out there, they would get
even a little more than the seven thousand dollars. The
question was, to raise the money for a railway ticket.
Some one must accompany me.</p>

<p>Day after day I heard them arguing. They brought
out men, and women too, from New York. They
would say that it was a sure thing, any one who went
in with them would be well rewarded, but everybody
seemed shy of advancing money enough for my
ticket, and one of theirs, to California.</p>

<p>All these difficulties pleased me. I, of course, viewed
with dismay a trip to California. Unfortunately for
me, a day came when a middle-aged man who was the
leader of a gang of forgers seemed to fall in with their
scheme. He had succeeded in passing a worthless
cheque on a trust company and was feeling very rich.
He told my young men that he would advance them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
one hundred and fifty dollars, if they would give him
a thousand when I was sold.</p>

<p>They were in a fury with him, and vowed they’d
see him somewhere first. However, I heard them
talking the thing over after he left, and I trembled
as they seemed to come to a decision in his favour.</p>

<p>I knew from their talk that my dear master was
advertising me much more extensively than they had
ever imagined he would, and that there were a great
many uncertainties connected with selling me, even
in so far-away a place as California. It was only by
a quick sale that they could hope to get rid of me
anywhere. Then they were afraid that some of their
gang, in spite of the danger to themselves on account
of their criminal record, would notify the police of
my whereabouts, and claim the reward. They had no
confidence in any one. On their blue days, they sometimes
went far enough to regret ever having meddled
with me, and I was in torture lest some treachery on
the part of their gangster friends would make them
kill me, and run away to hide themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, however, they promised to let the forger
have the thousand dollars when I was sold, though
they assured him that recent developments made it
impossible for them to ask the full price for me.</p>

<p>They were not sure that the forger would keep his
promise about letting them have the hundred and fifty
dollars. Talk about honour among thieves&mdash;the criminal
world, as I heard about it from my corner in the
shed, is dishonourable, untrue, frightfully selfish&mdash;there
is no such thing as honour in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>I must confess that I had had an idea that there
is something fascinating about crime. The night master
and Mr. Bonstone went to New York to warn the
police about the planned burglary of the jeweller’s
store, I had been secretly disappointed when they let
Mr. Johnson follow the affair up, and we went home.</p>

<p>I didn’t want a burglary to take place, or rogues
to be apprehended, but if the thing just had to be done,
I wanted to see how burglars and police went about it.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;my dog soul was filled with the most
awful and secret disgust and dread of this criminal
life. It was nauseating. I wished to sweep it from
the earth. At first I listened to the talk, then I buried
my head in the straw. Such things were not fit for
even a dog to hear.</p>

<p>I concentrated my attention on myself. I must
escape&mdash;but how? There seemed not one single avenue
open to me. I had always had a theory, that no
man and no dog can be put in any place so tight that
he can’t get out of it, but I seemed to be in such a
place now. I could think of absolutely nothing to do.</p>

<p>The scheme of these young villains was a very simple,
but a very cunning one. By instinct and habit,
they were natives of the very downest part of New
York. They had brought me to the country to escape
the keen eyes of the New York police, who, as I have
said before, are, in spite of the criticism they receive,
a pretty fine body of men.</p>

<p>The paler of the villains posed as a victim of tuberculosis.
His brother, who was not his brother at all,
had hired this tumble-down cottage as a place for him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to breathe fresh air and recover in. Whenever they
heard any one coming this Dud, as he was called,
would flop down on a rickety old sofa drawn up close
to an open window. I was his devoted black dog, kept
for company, while his brother, who was a hard-working
baker, was away in New York. He had to be a
baker, for his flabby hands never could have belonged
to a man who worked out-of-doors.</p>

<p>This pose was very clever, for it brought them in
lots of food. A good, kind clergyman told some of
the ladies in his congregation about the poor, sick,
young New Yorker who had such a bad cough, and
they came often and brought nourishing things to eat.</p>

<p>How my blood boiled when I saw these nice women
driving up in their cars, and sending their servants
in with dainty dishes for these two rapscallions, who
ate them and grumbled because there was not more
wine in the jellies.</p>

<p>To add to my misery, the dear old widow who
owned the Lady Gay cat found out about her needy
neighbours, and came quite often with little bowls of
custard.</p>

<p>My first impulse when I saw her was to spring to
my feet and bark wildly. However, I lay down again.
She would not recognise me. I was a black dog now.
The cat would know me, but then the cat never came
with her, and even if she had, at a hint of recognition
from any one, I would be spirited away. So I had to
content myself with wagging my tail violently whenever
she appeared, and I always got a kind pat on the
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when I was terribly weary from my long
confinement, and was quite a bit downcast, for I did
not see how I was ever going to get away, I became
desperate.</p>

<p>A beautiful old lady with a high-bred manner, was
standing in the cottage which was a one-roomed affair,
talking to Dud who was prone on the sofa coughing
in a hollow way.</p>

<p>I began to wail softly, and she turned round, and
looking out in the shed at me, said, “I should think
you would have your dog in here for company. The
room is cold, for you have only a feeble fire. He
could lie on the sofa, and keep you warm.”</p>

<p>The lady had been there before, and I knew she
liked dogs, for she wore a little button with “Be Kind
to Animals” on it.</p>

<p>Dud was too cunning to be caught. “I often have
him in here, ma’am,” he said. “I just put him out
there before you came.”</p>

<p>“Let him loose,” she said. “I would like to see
him run about.”</p>

<p>“He’s tired,” said Dud, “he was running all the
morning.”</p>

<p>He was watching her face as he spoke, and he
must have noticed a flash of suspicion, for he added
hastily, “Perhaps he does want to come in. I’ll try
him for a while. He likes to lie behind my back,”
and getting up, he limped out to the shed.</p>

<p>I was trembling with anger at his lies. He unfastened
my chain, and took me in his arms. His
face was hateful as he bent over me. I would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to pay up for this. He was holding me apparently
in a loose grasp, yet his left hand gripped one of my
hind legs till it felt as if it were caught in the jaws
of a trap.</p>

<p>I might have known better than to do what I did,
but I didn’t. I made an effort to get to the kind lady.
Her face made me wildly homesick, for it reminded
me of my dear mistress and Mrs. Bonstone. Then,
I was unutterably tired and heartsick. Three weeks
had passed since I had been shut up with this vermin
of manhood.</p>

<p>I tried to spring toward her, but my leg caught in
the trap. I gave a yell of pain. I thought my jailer
had broken it.</p>

<p>Dud was mighty clever. He let me go at once. He
knew I could not run far with that aching leg. “Poor
dog,” he said as I limped to a corner and began to
lick it. “Did the rheumatiz come back? I’ll get you
a bone,” and he went to a shelf and took down a piece
of beef that he had reserved for himself.</p>

<p>What a fool I am! I thought, and I lay down by the
stove, and ripped the meat off the bone, for they kept
me pretty hungry.</p>

<p>The lady was reassured, for Dud in a skilful manner
that amazed me, petted me as if he worshipped
the ground I walked on. I would not wag my tail,
and pretend I liked him, but I tore at the meat, for I
knew I should lose my bone, and probably get a beating
when the lady was gone.</p>

<p>I never looked at her as her chauffeur, who had
been standing outside, opened the door for her. Dud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
was very careful to keep between me and the door, but
he did not need to trouble. I felt that the time to
escape had not come.</p>

<p>Of course I got my beating. He snatched the bone
from me, and caught up an old broom. I shall carry
the mark of that beating to the end of my life in a
most ungraceful limp, for my poor sore leg seemed to
be always next the broom. I tried to keep my head
out of range of the blows. I had a terror of being
blind.</p>

<p>Fortunately, his companion vermin came in while
he was belabouring me, and I, poor dog, was flying
from corner to corner, from under the stove, to the
rickety sofa, and the shaky bedstead, to escape the
terrible broom handle.</p>

<p>His companion, who was fresh from some nest of
evil things in the city, called him a whole trainload
of dreadful names. They lost their tempers, and
fought. Was I sorry? I crouched under the bed and
tried to discipline myself.</p>

<p>I murmured, “I am a respectable dog. I should
grieve to see two young men so depraved. I should
be sorry to see them giving each other blows&mdash;now
Dud is down&mdash;his eye is laid open. I am terribly
pained.”</p>

<p>I turned my head away, and thought I looked intensely
sorry, but alas! an old tin pan that still had
some shine on it stood leaning against the baseboard,
and I saw reflected in it a distorted dog grin.</p>

<p>Well, Dud yelled so loudly, that Tike, as his chum
is called, had to desist. The postman often passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
about this time in the afternoon. They sat down,
and glared at each other like two young tigers&mdash;no, not
tigers, tigers are too noble. I can’t think of any animal
bad enough to compare them with. Hyenas would
have looked like gentlemen if set beside them.</p>

<p>Anyway, they sat and glowered, while Dud tied a
wet towel to his injured eye, then they got more composed
and Tike told his good news. I and Dud were
to set off for California the following week. He had
got the money.</p>

<p>Dud wanted to handle it, but Tike shook his head
and exhibited just the corners of some bills sticking
out of an inner pocket.</p>

<p>From composure, they passed to contentment. They
were both frightfully tired of their long sojourn in
the country. Listening to them, and consulting my
own feelings, as I looked back on three weeks of
being chained up, I concluded that the worst torture
in the world for man or beast, is to be torn away
from home and family and a happy active life, and
to have nothing to do but think about yourself and
your misery.</p>

<p>Finally Tike picked me up almost tenderly, told
Dud, for the fiftieth time, what kind of a fool he was
to beat a seven-thousand-dollar dog, and re-chained
me to my iron bar.</p>

<p>Then they sat down again, and confronted each
other. They were in high glee. They thought they
saw several thousand dollars glittering alluringly ahead
of them in far-off California. One thousand they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
would have to give to their friend&mdash;no, not their
friend, they hadn’t any&mdash;to their fellow-plotter.</p>

<p>They just had to do something to celebrate. In
New York, a dozen ways of jollification of their own
sort would have been open to them&mdash;in this country
place, there were but two things.</p>

<p>Tike went out and got some bottles somewhere.
Then they pulled down all the blinds, locked the house
door, and the outer shed door, lighted an old lamp,
and sat down at a table with some cards between
them.</p>

<p>They hadn’t a suspicion that I would try to escape.
Apparently, I was beaten almost to a jelly, but I am
a very strong dog, and I wasn’t half as done out as
I appeared to be.</p>

<p>Tike cast a glance at me occasionally, as I lay on
my straw bed, but soon he got interested in the cards
and the bottles and forgot all about me.</p>

<p>As I lay there, I was doing some pretty hard
thinking. Never before in my whole life had I felt
as I was now feeling. I was on fire with anger, and
I felt the strength of ten dogs in my body. I had
had all the worries and trials of an average dog in
the course of my life, but this rage of resentment was
an absolutely new experience. A most profound sympathy
for all tortured things came over me. I pitied
all the suffering men and women in the world, the
children, and poor dumb animals. Then I arranged
my little plan of escape. In the morning, I would
either be away from this place, or so done out that
I didn’t care what happened to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>First thing I must get some rest. Nothing could
be done till the two young brutes inside had been put
to sleep by the stuff in the bottles.</p>

<p>I am a pretty determined dog, and I made myself
drop into a heavy slumber. About one o’clock, I woke
up. The most extraordinary snoring duet I ever heard
in my life was going on in the room beyond me, and
I could see where the two poor wretches had thrown
themselves, undressed, across the bed. They were
safe for some hours.</p>

<p>The lamp was just smoking out. It would soon be
dark, but I knew every inch of the ground about me,
and the darkness would not interfere with what I had
to do.</p>

<p>For the thousandth time since my captivity, I smelt
round the iron bar to which I was chained. That bar
had to come out of the ground. There was no other
way of escape, for it was impossible for me to detach
my metal collar from the steel chain that fastened me
to the bar.</p>

<p>I must dig my way out. Fortunately, my legs are
very muscular, for I have been a dog that has taken
a great deal of exercise, and back of me are generations
of fox-terriers trained to unearth foxes in old
England.</p>

<p>The hind leg that Dud had pinched was terribly
sore and wobbly, and at first seemed almost useless.</p>

<p>“None of that nonsense,” I said sternly to it.
“You’ve got to be stood on.” So I propped myself
on it as best I could, and began to clear the earth from
that uncompromising bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a hard task. I can not deny that. All over
the shed, the earth had been trodden on till it was
apparently as firm as marble. But even marble can
be penetrated, and I scratched and clawed, till I had
a small hole dug. After that it was easier, the earth
underneath was softer, but ah! me, how my paws
began to ache.</p>

<p>I found the best way to manage was to dig till I
dropped exhausted to the ground. Then I would close
my eyes and rest my aching limbs for a few minutes.
Just as soon as possible, I would get up, prop myself
firmly on my one sound hind leg, rest the tender one
gingerly on the earth, and start digging again.</p>

<p>When the first faint streaks of daylight came filtering
through the broken boards of the roof, I had got
the bar uprooted, and had begun to tunnel under the
boards of the shed wall. My strength was almost
gone. I had to take long times of resting, and short
ones of digging. My claws were all worn off, and
my paws were bleeding. I had to set my teeth, and
think of master and mistress and all my beloved friend
dogs, to enable me to keep to work.</p>

<p>Once I thought I was done for. One of the sleeping
beauties in the room got off the bed, floundered
about, and acted as if he were coming out to call on
me.</p>

<p>My first thought was to spring up and try to cover
the hole I had made with straw, but that would have
been an impossibility, and I lay still, and wondered
what was going to happen next.</p>

<p>Tike, for it was he that was stirring, had the will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
but not the power to get to the shed, and falling in a
heap on the floor, he went to snoring.</p>

<p>I tried to get up, and go on with my work, but it
seemed as if I were paralysed. “Oh! for a stimulus,”
I muttered, “my limbs are dead,” and just here something
happened that was little short of miraculous.</p>

<p>It seems a far cry from that shed to a little black
cat in New York, more than two years before, but it
wasn’t.</p>

<p>The Lady Gay cat that I had befriended, and who
belonged to the good old widow Gorman, was named
Mollie. In common with all pussies, she had a habit
of night-prowling. She was a cautious cat, and after
her New York experience never went far from home,
but on this particular night, she told me afterward,
something had prompted her to wander further than
usual.</p>

<p>She was just getting home, for it was near morning,
when in crossing the field near the cottage, she heard
the sound of my digging. It aroused her curiosity,
and she came smelling round the shed. She soon
caught a suggestion of me, and she mewed excitedly,
for she had heard the widow tell about my being
stolen from the kind gentleman who used to come
sometimes to the cottage. Her voice was the stimulus
I needed. I put my muzzle close to a crack in the
board wall, and squealed gently, “Here I am, Mollie.”</p>

<p>“Are you with the black dog of the sick man?” she
mewed.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> the black dog, Mollie,” I said. “I’m trying
to dig myself out. I’m most dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! Boy,” she said, “how I wish I could help
you.”</p>

<p>“You can,” I replied, “run and get your German
police dog. I heard your Granny tell the two young
men that her sons had sent her one to guard her, for
they were afraid something might happen to her in
your lonely cottage.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said, “good Oscar, he’s very intelligent.”</p>

<p>“Fly,” I begged her. “They may wake any time.”</p>

<p>The little cat scampered away, and soon I heard
a few stealthy sounds outside, and then a long indrawn
sniff from Oscar, and a stifled “Woof!” He
was locating me.</p>

<p>The cat had explained the circumstances to him, as
they ran along together. He signalled to me to begin
at my end of the tunnel. I started digging like a wild
dog, and he began tunnelling to meet me.</p>

<p>His paws are magnificent&mdash;so big and strong, and
he had the acute hearing of a healthy dog. He could
even hear my heart beating as I worked. In a very
few minutes, I was down on the earth, crawling on
my stomach out through my tunnel into his.</p>

<p>I fell on the grass in a heap. Oscar gave me one
rapid lick, then ran his nose over the bar and chain.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” urged Mollie who was trembling
with excitement. “It’s getting quite light.”</p>

<p>It seemed still dark to me, for I was almost blind
from fatigue.</p>

<p>That sagacious dog picked up the bar in his strong,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
white teeth, walked slowly ahead, and I dragged myself
after him.</p>

<p>That walk to the widow’s house was a nightmare
of pain. I was tormented in every limb. Mollie ran
ahead, and mewed at the back door, and the widow,
who was half dressed only, opened it and stared at
us in amazement.</p>

<p>“The black dog,” she said, “and Mollie with him,
and Oscar carrying his bar. Goodness gracious!
What does this mean?”</p>

<p>In the midst of my pain and confusion, I remembered
that I must identify myself. I crawled to the
corner of the fireplace where she always set my saucer
of milk, when master was having his cup of tea, for
we often called here when out automobiling. I
squealed and tried to jump in the air, but tumbled forward
instead.</p>

<p>Good old Granny was very sharp. She gave me a
perfectly amazed look, then she screamed, “Good
London&mdash;it’s the Granton dog&mdash;but black, so black,”
she added.</p>

<p>She dashed to the water bucket, seized a towel,
wet it, and began to rub my coat.</p>

<p>“It’s dye,” she screamed again. “My goodness!
my goodness! my goodness!”</p>

<p>The dear old soul caught me up, bar and chain,
dirty and bedraggled, ran to her own bed, and put
me on it, then she flew to the telephone that her boys
had given her, and called up central.</p>

<p>The girl who answered was called Minnie, and was
a particular friend of the old woman’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“Minnie,” she gasped, “the police, quick, it’s
Granny Gorman speaking. I’ve found the Granton
dog that’s been so much advertised. He was over in
the cottage by the grove with the sick young man.
A man that’s bad enough to steal a dog, would hurt a
helpless old woman&mdash;quick, Minnie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gorman let the receiver drop, flew to the
back door, and locked it, flew to the front door, and
locked that. Then she put down all the windows, and
locked them. Then she got a bottle of milk, and put
some in my mouth with a teaspoon.</p>

<p>Never again will anything taste to me as that milk
did. My body was frightfully tired, but my mind followed
acutely what went on.</p>

<p>Oscar, who had pushed his head under a window
shade, and was staring in the direction of the other
cottage, gave a warning bark.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gorman stepped to the window, then she
joined her hands, cast a pleading look toward the
ceiling and said, “Oh, Lord&mdash;they’re coming.”</p>

<p>Oscar told me afterward that the sight of those
two confused, staggering young fellows zig-zagging
across the field made him grin. They had not recovered
from the effects of their rejoicing, but something
in their poor brains had warned them to set out
in chase of their lost property.</p>

<p>They were following the tracks of the chain that
had dragged on the earth, and every time they stopped
to look, they would fall down. Oscar said afterward
that it was a dreadful thing to laugh at drunken men,
but he couldn’t help shaking his sides over their antics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon they got up to the house, and after cutting the
telephone wire, staggered through the garden to the
front door. After they had pounded a short time,
Mrs. Gorman went to the little hall window, and
without raising it, looked out at them.</p>

<p>They called her some very fancy names, and ordered
her to let them in.</p>

<p>“What for?” she screamed through the glass.
“You’re not in a state to make calls. Go home.”</p>

<p>“Give us our dog,” they yelled, pounding on the
door with their fists.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got your dog,” the widow called back
to them. Then she realised she had made a mistake.
She didn’t want them to know she had discovered I
was the Granton dog.</p>

<p>“That good dog doesn’t want to live with you,” she
shouted. “He scratched his way out. You’d better
let me keep him.”</p>

<p>This excited the two young scamps, and they began
throwing themselves against the door and kicking at it.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do that,” she exclaimed, “breaking into
a house is a penitentiary offence.”</p>

<p>Dud and Tike were pretty well worked up now.
They knew their case was desperate. They must get
hold of me, and rush off to New York. The shock
had sobered them, and one of them smashed the hall
window with his fist, and ran his hand in to unlock the
door.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” said the widow much more calmly,
“don’t do that,” and she threw the door wide open.
“Come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>They were a very cunning pair. Dud stood outside,
while Tike entered. He came right to the bed, snatched
a key from his pocket, and unlocking my collar, released
me from the bar and chain, and took me in his
arms.</p>

<p>“Come, come, young man,” said the widow coaxingly,
“that dog is afraid of you. Leave him with me.”</p>

<p>I felt Tike give a kind of jerk. He had sense enough
to know that he should not leave a suspicious person
behind him. He wanted to find out what she had in
her mind.</p>

<p>“I hope in future you’ll mind your own business,”
he said roughly, “and not take in a runaway dog.”</p>

<p>“But I like dogs,” she said gently, and as she spoke,
she laid a hand on Oscar’s collar. The intelligent dog
stood watching her. At a word, he would have leaped
on Tike, and Tike knew it.</p>

<p>“Don’t play any tricks with me, doggie,” he said in
a hateful way, and he half pulled a neat little revolver
from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Please put that back,” said Granny Gorman, “I
hate guns.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not hurt you,” said Tike, “if you don’t hurt
me.”</p>

<p>“Why should I hurt you?” asked the widow mildly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tike sullenly, then he went on,
“I’m off for home.”</p>

<p>The widow detained him. “Promise me you’ll be
kind to the dog in future,” she said.</p>

<p>Tike made this promise readily enough, then he tried
to escape. He was reassured in his own mind. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
widow knew nothing of the value of the dog in his
arms.</p>

<p>He found it hard to get away. Mrs. Gorman took
him by the sleeve. She poured out a perfect volume
of talk about dumb animals, and the importance of being
kind to them.</p>

<p>At last Tike said rudely, “Lemme go,” and he pulled
away from her.</p>

<p>Just as quickly as he pulled away, he shrank back.
The milkman, who was a big husky countryman, had
just drawn his wagon up before the little garden, and
was coming up the walk to the front door with two
bottles of milk in his hand.</p>

<p>From my place of vantage in Tike’s arms, I saw a
surprised look flit over the widow’s face. Evidently,
the man came usually to the back door.</p>

<p>Then, through the half open door, we all listened
to what he was saying to Dud who stood part way
up the walk.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said the milkman, “how’s your cough?
You’re out early for a sick man.”</p>

<p>“Better,” said Dud in a stifled voice. “I was upset
about my dog&mdash;came to get him. He ran away.”</p>

<p>“Did he,” said the milkman indifferently. Then his
eye fell on the broken glass.</p>

<p>“Hi!” he said in a drawling voice, “looks as if the
widder had been getting gay.”</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” said Dud gruffly. “I guess my
dog did it. He often rampages round, and breaks
things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“That medium-sized black feller,” said the milkman&mdash;“always
looks mild as milk to me.”</p>

<p>“He’s awful when he gets started,” said Dud&mdash;“a
regular spitfire. That’s why we keep him chained&mdash;I
say, you’re not going near the station, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes I am,” said the milkman in a careless way,
“within a hundred feet&mdash;want a lift?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Dud. “I’m beginning to feel bad.
I guess I’ll go to town, and see my doctor.”</p>

<p>“Jump in, then,” said the milkman hospitably, and
setting down his bottles, he went toward the back of
the waggon, and appeared to be moving something
inside.</p>

<p>Dud looked over his shoulder, and called out, “Come
on, Tike,” then he started toward the waggon.</p>

<p>Oscar and I both sensed the presence of strangers.
The milkman was fooling the two young men. I
watched the hair rising and falling on Oscar’s back,
and wondered at his self-control, for he sat quietly
near the widow, waiting for orders.</p>

<p>The waggon was a big one, drawn by two powerful
horses. We saw Dud approach the front of it. He
was going to take the seat with the milkman, and let
Tike crawl in behind with me. The first one always
took the best thing.</p>

<p>He climbed to the seat, was just about to sit down,
when he stopped short, and gazed into the back of the
waggon.</p>

<p>The milkman gave a great roar of laughter.
“They’re only bottles&mdash;go in and look at them,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
he gave the slender Dud a push that sent him disappearing
from view.</p>

<p>Tike had seen his companion’s start, and I knew
from the tremor of his body that he was vaguely suspicious
of something, he knew not what. He didn’t
know what to do, and his eyes were glued to the milkman’s
face as he came again toward the house and
seized his bottles.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tike,” called Dud suddenly from the
waggon.</p>

<p>Now Tike was reassured. He clutched me closer,
stepped out in quite a steady manner, but he did not
get far&mdash;the milkman, grinning in a most alarming
way, raised his bottles, jerked their contents in Tike’s
face, wetting me more than my captor, and in no wise
discommoding me, for my body was on fire.</p>

<p>Tike, in his astonishment, struck out at the milkman,
and I was slipping to the ground, when the milkman
caught me and stood jeering at the confounded Tike
who went staggering into the arms of two policemen
who had sprung from the waggon.</p>

<p>Dud was inside with handcuffs on. The policemen
had got the milkman to bring them to the cottage.
They didn’t want any shooting, and when they drew
Dud into the back part of the waggon, he, to curry
favour with them, called his companion.</p>

<p>Well, that was the last of my two enemies for me.
I never expect to see them again. They were never
accused of stealing me. It was found that they belonged
to a gang that had swindled big New York concerns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and they will probably serve a long term in
prison for their previous crimes.</p>

<p>My dear master was asked to interfere on their behalf,
but he said, “They will be with a good warden.
Years ago, I might have done something. Now it is
too late for any mild measures. They have sinned
deeply, and they need the discipline of punishment.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">THE HAPPIEST TIME OF MY LIFE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The milkman laid me back on Mrs. Gorman’s
bed, and in a very short time, the best physician
in the neighbourhood was bending over me.</p>

<p>He didn’t think it beneath his dignity to be of service
to a dog. He put some cool dressing on my wounded
paws, bound them up, and told Mrs. Gorman not to
disturb them. Then he went away, and said he would
call later in the day.</p>

<p>By that time, my dear master had arrived, and was
sitting beside me.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget that meeting! Master broke
down. “My poor Boy&mdash;my poor Boy,” he said, and
he took my head between his hands.</p>

<p>I was almost delirious with joy. I couldn’t stand
up, so I just rolled over and over on the bed, and
kicked in ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Lie still, lie still, Boy,” he said with tears in his
eyes, and he gently pushed me back to my proper position.
“My poor little lad&mdash;a regular sapper, engineer
dog&mdash;dug yourself out of prison. Well, there’s
one thing sure. You’ll never be in one again. I’ve
bought a pair of police dogs, and they patrol the place
day and night. You are a brave little doggie, but you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
have a good heart, and you don’t always know evil
characters.”</p>

<p>As he spoke about German dogs, Oscar came pushing
his muzzle toward him.</p>

<p>“You grand young animal,” said master, fondling
him. “I can not be grateful enough to you. Granny
Gorman,” and master called over his shoulder to the
dear old woman who as of old was making him a
cup of tea, “you must do something for your dog when
you get your reward.”</p>

<p>Granny came toward the bed with her brown tea-pot
in her hand. “What reward, sir?”</p>

<p>“The reward for finding my Boy. The cheque is all
ready whenever you are.”</p>

<p>She made big round eyes at him, inside her widow’s
cap. “Why, sir, the police caught those men.”</p>

<p>“You and your dog found my dog,” said master
decidedly. “The money is yours.”</p>

<p>She dropped the tea-pot in her amazement. “Not
two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Yes, two thousand dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>She stood deliberating a long time. Her eyes went
to the picture of her deceased husband on the wall,
to the framed wreath taken from his coffin, to the photograph
of her two boys standing clasping each other
in an almost death grip. Then she said very slowly,
“You’re a rich man, and I s’pose it don’t seem anything
to you, but to me it’s a fortune.”</p>

<p>“I wish it were ten thousand,” he said heartily.
“However, one can’t measure gratitude by money. I’m
your friend for life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir, that’s better than the money,” she said with a
smile running all over her wrinkled old face. “If you’ll
bring that lovely dog of yours to see me sometimes,
it’ll be better than bags of gold to me.”</p>

<p>Master didn’t say any more, and she didn’t. They
understood each other. He made her sit down, while
he picked up the pieces of broken tea-pot from the rag
mat, then he came back to me.</p>

<p>“You little rascal,” he said lovingly, “I believe I’ll
be a beggar soon, if you keep on. Exhibiting you in
that show has dragged me into endless litigation. The
pictures and descriptions of you in the newspapers have
brought former owners buzzing about my ears like
angry bees. I’ve had to buy you over and over again,
and your kidnapping cost me a heap more.”</p>

<p>I licked his strong hands. My dear master&mdash;he
would sell his house, before he would part with me.
Then I looked anxiously in his face. He knew what I
wanted, and he began to tell me about home affairs.
“Young George has mourned you like a brother,” he
said smilingly. “He has gone about the house wailing,
‘I want my Borsie&mdash;I want my Borsie,’ and when
night came, and you did not appear for your frolic in
the nursery, he has often cried with disappointment.”</p>

<p>“And mistress,” I wondered as I gazed at him.</p>

<p>“She has been perfectly upset about you,” he said,
“and Amarilla. The little dog is pining away, and
looks like a skeleton. We did not know that she was
so fond of you. The veterinary says that if you do
not return soon, she will die. As soon as I had the
telephone message from police headquarters here, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
shouted the news of your recovery through the house,
and Amarilla acted like a wild creature. Afterward,
for she has little strength, she fell down exhausted.”</p>

<p>I was terribly excited at this news. I tried to stagger
to my feet. I whined, and begged him to take me
home.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would hurt you,” he said good-humouredly,
“though I forgot to ask your physician.”
He laughed at me as he said this, and went to the telephone.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t been mended, sir, since those young rascals
cut it,” said Granny.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll run over and see him in my car,” said
master, and he went to the door.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he came back. “It’s all right, Boy.
Come along, we’ll go home.”</p>

<p>Granny Gorman carried out pillows and coverlets,
and put a hot water bottle beside me, for the afternoon
was cold. Wasn’t I a happy dog!&mdash;Master whistled
like a boy, as we sped on our way home.</p>

<p>I lay as snug as possible on the floor of the racing-car,
but it seemed a long time before we got on the
Pleasant River Road, although we were going like the
wind.</p>

<p>However, we came at last within sight of the lights
of the avenue. I heard master say, “Hello! Baron
Ledgar, jump right in. We’re open to inspection,” and
he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>A powerful German police dog stepped in cautiously
beside me, and nosed my bundle of wraps.</p>

<p>“So,” he said in a deep foreign voice, “you are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
dogling there has been such a stir about. If you want
to get stolen again, it won’t be at night. I’m on guard
then.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Danke</i>,” I murmured, “you are a good fellow; I
can tell by the sound of your voice.”</p>

<p>“No compliments,” he said gruffly, “just work, work&mdash;Boo,
hoo! boo hoo!” and he howled like a siren.</p>

<p>Master burst out laughing, and stopped to let him
out. “I never saw such zeal,” he exclaimed. “You
want to be on guard all the time. A short drive would
not take up too much time.”</p>

<p>Baron Ledgar, with an exceedingly intense manner,
leaped out before the machine stood still, and went on
with his work of examining every inch of ground about
the estate.</p>

<p>“He’s a treasure,” said master enthusiastically;
“doesn’t hurt any one but keeps every stranger under
surveillance. You other dogs can sleep o’ nights now.
If any wanderers come, the Baron and his brother policeman
dog will take care of them.”</p>

<p>I whined to let him know I was listening, and he went
on gaily, “There’s a great fashion of giving double
sir-names and handles to dogs and horses’ names.
You’re Boy of Pleasant River now, if it please you.
You’re too distinguished for just plebeian Boy.”</p>

<p>I gave a kind of dog chuckle. How little I cared
what I was called, as long as I was permitted to live
with him.</p>

<p>It seemed to me my heart would burst with joy when
the car drew up before the big hall door and dogs
and human beings rushed out to greet me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Good King Harry was there, and Cannie and Czarina,
all barking and jumping with excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p>“Make way there, make way there for the distinguished
hero&mdash;Boy of Pleasant River,” called master,
and taking me in his arms, he carried me into the hall
and laid me on the settle.</p>

<p>Mistress was about to lay hold of me, but drew back
at the sight of my blackness.</p>

<p>“Oh! Rudolph,” she said, “I didn’t realise what the
dark colour would be. It isn’t our Boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is your Boy,” I squealed, and I reached my
tongue far out and licked her hands.</p>

<p>“You poor, poor doggie,” she said, “how you have
suffered,” and she patted and caressed me, and then
examined her hands to see if the black came off.</p>

<p>“We’ll have it all washed off in a few days,” said
master. “He’s a sick dog yet.”</p>

<p>Just here, I gave a sharp bark of excitement. Master
had hinted at a surprise waiting for me, and now
I knew what it was. The surprise was Beanie.</p>

<p>That dear dog was on his hind legs beside the settle,
licking me, nosing me, assuring me that he loved
me as well as he did the mournful day two years ago,
when he had to go down South with Ellen.</p>

<p>I should, perhaps, have explained before, that the
reason why Beanie never saw young George, and never
came to Pleasant River, was on account of Ellen receiving
sudden news of the illness of her only sister
down in Virginia.</p>

<p>She had started off for that state in a great hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
taking Beanie with her. The sister had died leaving
her some money, and she had come back to New York
to see her son Robert Lee, who was now married, and
master had invited her to come out to Pleasant River.</p>

<p>“Beanie, Beanie,” I gasped, “how handsome you
look&mdash;and if I’m not glad to see you. Where’s old
Ellen?”</p>

<p>“There,” he exclaimed, looking over his shoulder,
and lifting my head a little more, I saw Ellen coming
down the staircase, leading young George. Bessie had
gone away to care for a sick mother, and Ellen was
taking care of our baby.</p>

<p>Wasn’t that good old woman glad to see me! “Why
didn’t you run to old Ellen,” she said lovingly, “the
way you did when you was lost before?”</p>

<p>My mind harked back to the time I first saw her, but
I could not very well explain that this affair had been
different from my voluntary running away.</p>

<p>Young George’s face was a study. He had heard
that his playmate had come back, and he had his fresh
young mouth wide open, as if he were going to swallow
something nice.</p>

<p>At first, I felt sorry that they had allowed him to see
me in my present state. He was only a baby. My
colour would frighten him, and he would think I was
a strange dog.</p>

<p>That is where I miscalculated. I might have known
how he would take the thing, and I might have remembered
how often I have said, that children are cleverer
than grown people.</p>

<p>His dear mother was shrinking a little bit from me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
George, after getting off the staircase, trotted up to me,
and threw his arms round my neck. He didn’t hesitate
an instant. He knew I was his own Borsie.</p>

<p>“Bad man,” he said after he had nearly hugged me
to death, “bad man&mdash;make Dordie’s Borsie brack!”
and seizing a corner of his little pajama jacket, he spat
on it, and tried to rub some of my dye off.</p>

<p>His mother exclaimed, “How primitive&mdash;George,
my darling, don’t spit on things.”</p>

<p>“’Pittin’s easy,” he said, and he started to polish
me off again, when his father interfered, and promising
him the pleasure of properly washing some of the
colour off the next day, sent him back to bed.</p>

<p>As he climbed upstairs, holding tight to Ellen’s
hand, I heard a gentle noise such as a cat might make,
and leaning my head over the settle, saw Amarilla toddling
toward me.</p>

<p>What a little skeleton!&mdash;I was terribly shocked.</p>

<p>“Poor girlie,” said mistress, “now you will get fat,”
and she lifted her up beside me.</p>

<p>Amarilla never said a word. She gave me a perfectly
heart-rending glance from her big frightened
eyes, and cuddled up close to me. She lay there till
they carried me up to master’s room, when she followed
behind like a little mourner.</p>

<p>“Amarilla!” called mistress later on, when I had
been placed on my own bed which was a big French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bergère</i> in master’s dressing-room, “aren’t you coming
to sleep in my room?”</p>

<p>I heard a little stirring beside my chair, but she did
not go to mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>“Claudia,” said master, “I advise you to leave her
in the same room with Boy for a day or two. She
has had a great fright about him. She will go back
to you later.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said mistress in her pretty voice, and
master bending down took the trembling Amarilla, and
put her on a cushioned bench close to my chair. “You
mustn’t touch his bandaged feet, doggie,” he said to
her, but there was no need of warning her. The anxious
little dog just wished to be near me. She was
dazed from suffering, and was afraid that I would go
away again. What a faithful little heart!</p>

<p>“Amarilla,” I said, “I missed you and Gringo more
than any other of the dogs.”</p>

<p>She still said nothing, but she stretched out her tiny
pink tongue, and licked my bandages very softly.</p>

<p>“Go to sleep,” I said, “we shall have some fine romps
on the lawn when my feet get better.”</p>

<p>She drew a long, pitiful sigh, and closed her eyes.
How could any one ever ill-treat a timid shrinking thing
like that. I can understand how a man can beat a fox-terrier
but a toy-spaniel&mdash;never!</p>

<p>I did not go to sleep for some time, for there was
something on my mind. I wanted to see Gringo. I
wondered that the dear old fellow had not been over
to welcome me. Surely he knew that I had come home.
I thought he would be the first to greet me. Surely
that lie would not be bothering him yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span class="cheaderfont">MY OWN DEAR HOME</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Bright and early the next morning, I heard a
sniffling at master’s dressing-room door, followed
by a knock.</p>

<p>Master opened the door, and there stood Mr. Bonstone
and Gringo.</p>

<p>They both came toward me, and Mr. Bonstone fondled
my head. “Fine Boy,” he said, “you did some
good foot-work.”</p>

<p>Then he began talking to master who was brushing
his hair vigorously with his military brushes. The two
men were like brothers.</p>

<p>Gringo came close to my chair.</p>

<p>“Hello, old boy,” I said, then we stared at each
other.</p>

<p>There was a most beautiful expression in his dark
eyes. “Gringo,” I said in a low voice, “you missed
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve not had a minute’s peace since you left,” he
said. “I’ve suffered more than you did.”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” I returned hastily.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he said. “I was a brute. The morning
after you disappeared, I went over to Greenlands and
got Reddy O’Mare. ‘Make yourself at home,’ I said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and he’s been over to our place every day since, and
I don’t boss the youngsters so much. I have to a bit,
seems as if it’s in my blood.”</p>

<p>“You’re a great old dog,” I said admiringly, “but
don’t think of the past. We’re going to have lots of
good times in the future.”</p>

<p>“So long,” he said abruptly. “My boss has to get
to town.”</p>

<p>I watched him rocking out of the room. How the
old dog had aged. I was quite shocked.</p>

<p>My convalescence was rapid. Not many days later,
I had my bandages off, and was able to limp about
the place.</p>

<p>The first day I was strong enough to get up to the
orchard, I received what the newspapers call an “ovation.”
It was a lovely day, and not too cold. The
dogs formed a circle about me on the snow, and I had
to relate the story of my capture.</p>

<p>I looked round on their faces&mdash;our Pleasant River
dogs, the Green Hill dogs, Reddy O’Mare and many
other neighbour dogs, and a sudden shyness fell upon
me.</p>

<p>Gringo was chairman, and to give me a chance to recover,
he began to tell how I was caught, and purposely
related it in a wrong way.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t like that,” I interrupted, and the old
dog, with a smile, told me to go on, and finish the
story properly.</p>

<p>I got excited, and talked for an hour. Then we
had a jubilation. The dogs all ran round and round,
and frisked and barked, and watching them, I shouted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
suddenly, “Hurrah for American dogs&mdash;we beat the
world!”</p>

<p>They all barked a chorus of approval, then we separated.
Gringo and I kept together, and had one of
our old-time walks and talks.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to your place,” I said. “I don’t believe
it would be too much for me.”</p>

<p>“Lean on me, if it hurts you to walk,” he said affectionately.</p>

<p>I pressed close to the dear old fellow, and as we
sauntered along, we gossiped.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” I said, “what a pleasure it is to
have Beanie here.”</p>

<p>“He had a great time down South,” said Gringo,
“but he was glad to get back to little old New York.”</p>

<p>“Strange to say, I’ve been on that big estate he
visited,” I said, “used to be an old plantation that belonged
to one of the F. F. V.’s.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Gringo.</p>

<p>“First Families of Virginia&mdash;Ellen’s sister was a
mammy on the place.”</p>

<p>“Ellen’s going to stay with you, I guess,” said
Gringo.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” I said. “Why, she’s only supposed
to be visiting.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I heard your master tell my boss that
he is pleased to have a Southern mammy for young
George. She has ideas about flowers and animals that
your boss likes.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be splendid,” I said. “Beanie is frightfully
worried about leaving Mrs. Granton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is a regular steady and true dog,” said Gringo.
“When he came, he didn’t know which to follow, old
Ellen, or your mistress, so he settled it, by tracking
one of them for half a day, and the other for the next
half.”</p>

<p>I laughed at this, and Gringo went on. “The other
day, I saw your boss watching Ellen with joy on his
face. It was in your greenhouse, and young George
had yanked a hyacinth from a pot. Ellen half cried,
and said the poor mother hyacinth had been in prison
in the black earth, and finally she worked her way
out, and shook her curls at the sun, and then George
came along, and tore her all to bits. The youngster
sniffed too, and helped Ellen tie mother hyacinth up
with a bit of string. Your boss liked that. He hates
to see his boy destroy life.”</p>

<p>“Good,” I said, “I hope she’ll stay. Do you suppose,
Gringo, if those two young scamps that stole
me had had the same chance that George has, they
would be so bad?”</p>

<p>“’Course not,” said the old dog.</p>

<p>“Then why in heaven’s name,” I said, “don’t human
beings give all the boys and girls an equal
chance?”</p>

<p>“Give it up,” said Gringo.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s selfishness,” I said, blinking my eyes
in the bright sunlight on the snow, for my sight had
got weak in my prison.</p>

<p>“There’s Sir Walter,” said Gringo, “giving his hens
a last run before sundown. He keeps them in fine
shape. See him nose them along. He’s a wise dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>As he waited to speak to Sir Walter, Arnulf the
police dog trotted by. He did not stop&mdash;just gave
us a rapid wag of his tail.</p>

<p>Walter Scott gazed after him. “It fatigues me to
watch him,” he said. “He’s never still.”</p>

<p>“No matter about that,” said Gringo, “he’s here
to keep strangers off the place, and he does it. They
used to be always poking about, when us other dogs
ruled. We were too polite by a long way. We never
drove strangers away, unless they were rampageous.”</p>

<p>Sir Walter smiled, and said, “I daresay you are
right. I saw him the other day get in front of a
woman who persisted in coming up through the open
gates. She thought he looked kind, and began to tear
ivy from the wall. Arnulf growled at her, but she
went on. Then he took her skirt between his teeth,
and tore it. She was in a rage, and started throwing
some ivy in his face. He opened his mouth, and bellowed
so angrily, that she hurried away, looking over
her shoulder&mdash;Pardon me, I must keep my hens moving.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Gringo, “the sun will soon be going
down.”</p>

<p>We went on, via the rock walk, and Gringo hung his
head as we passed the place where the two men had
lassoed me.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said hoarsely, “do you see that spot
there, all pressed down?”</p>

<p>I stuck my head in the alders, and saw a matted
place in the grass quite free from snow.</p>

<p>“I always keep it clean,” he said. “I used to sit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
there when you were gone and think what a good dog
you are, and what an old crosspatch I am.”</p>

<p>I began to laugh. I was so happy I couldn’t help it.
“Don’t be too humble,” I said, “we may have another
falling out.”</p>

<p>Gringo was quite shocked, and stopped short.</p>

<p>“Why not,” I said gaily. “Fight, and forgive, and
make up&mdash;fight, and forgive, and make up. That’s
life.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in fighting,” said Gringo soberly.</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” said I, “but if fights come, don’t dodge
them. Dogs aren’t perfect, nor are human beings.”</p>

<p>“My boss don’t fight his wife,” said Gringo.</p>

<p>“Nor does mine,” I retorted, “but sometimes they
are just a little sharp with each other. Then they kiss
and make up. You and I have kissed, and made up.
I don’t want you to go mourning all your days, because
you once snapped at me. It was partly my fault.
I got on your dog nerves.”</p>

<p>Gringo grinned at me. Then he said, “You’re a
comic dog&mdash;trouble runs off you like water off a duck’s
back&mdash;Good land! how I’ve missed you. Come on,
let’s trot a bit. It won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Cows first,” I said when we struck Green Hill, and
I limped into the stable. I loved Mr. Bonstone’s Jerseys,
and the big fragrant creatures, chewing their cud,
boo-hooed at me, for they knew I liked them, and they
had heard of my adventures.</p>

<p>I went from stall to stall and greeted them, then rejoined
Gringo, who was fussing about the stable door
because I was so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on up to see the horses,” he said. “I see my
boss just going up with an S. P. C. A. man he brought
out from the city to-day.”</p>

<p>I limped gleefully after him. The Green Hill stables
always reminded me of the Leland Stanford stables
in California, which are kept so quiet for the
horses, and where they have the same intelligent care
as they do here.</p>

<p>The S. P. C. A. gentleman was quite old, and he was
standing beside Mr. Bonstone, and staring about him
with great interest.</p>

<p>The stable doors were wide open. Each horse or
colt had a good-sized box-stall to himself, and every
one of them was turned head toward the door, watching
Thomas who was repairing a cement combination
drinking-fountain in the middle of the stable yard. It
was for human beings, horses, birds and dogs. Something
had gone wrong in the foundation, and Thomas
was on his knees on the ground, with a pail of cement
beside him, and a hammer and chisel.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” said Mr. Bonstone, “talk a bit to the
horses, will you?”</p>

<p>Thomas touched his cap, and was about to get up
but Mr. Bonstone said, “Keep on with your work, and
call them about you as I have seen you do.”</p>

<p>Thomas, who is a very quiet, but a very intelligent,
man of English ancestry, said, “All right, sir,” and
seizing the hammer, he threw it to one side and called
out, “Fernbrook Deputy, bring me the big hammer
from the tool-box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman in the big fur coat turned his
spectacles in the direction of the stable.</p>

<p>Fernbrook, who is a powerful bay horse, was lifting
up the bar of his stall with his teeth. Afterward, he
pounded the whole length of the stable with his heavy
hoofs, bent over a tool-box, took out a large hammer,
and dropped it beside Thomas.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone smiled proudly, and the old gentleman
said, “Magnificent!”</p>

<p>“Dollie Whitehead, bring me my coat,” called
Thomas, going on with his pounding.</p>

<p>A dapper little white mare let herself out of her
stall, went up to a hook where an overcoat was hanging,
and carried it out to the yard, holding it high so
it would not drag on the snow.</p>

<p>As she stood dangling it from her mouth, Thomas
jumped up and said rebukingly, “Why don’t you help
her put it on me, Fernbrook?”</p>

<p>To the old gentleman’s surprise&mdash;Mr. Bonstone,
Gringo and I had, of course, seen these performances
many times before&mdash;the two sagacious animals held
the coat by the back of the neck, while Thomas slipped
his arms in it.</p>

<p>“Major Golderay,” called Thomas, “I want you.”</p>

<p>A roan horse&mdash;a perfect beauty&mdash;came stepping
daintily out.</p>

<p>“Also Duchess of Normandy,” said Thomas, “Lady
Jane Grey, and Poor Polly.”</p>

<p>The animals all came out, and formed a line-up before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lady Jane,” said Thomas, “where is your friend
Joe?”</p>

<p>Lady Jane whinnied several times, and shook her
head in the direction of the barn.</p>

<p>“I know he’s bedding the cows,” said Thomas, “but
you go tell him I want him.”</p>

<p>Lady Jane galloped away, and presently returned
with her teeth in the shoulder of the woolen sweater
worn by the grinning Joe, who bobbed his head at his
employer and guest.</p>

<p>The old gentleman began to speak. “This is almost
equal to the thinking horses of Elberfeld.”</p>

<p>“Can you state to me,” asked Mr. Bonstone, “any
reason why an American horse should not have as
much brains as a German horse?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” said the old gentleman. “Horses,
like men, are created equal. Tell me, stableman, what
is your system?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any, sir,” said Thomas. “I treat ’em as
if they had horse sense, and I find they’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“Cultivation, cultivation,” said the old gentleman
several times, as he nodded his head. Then he asked,
“Can they count?”</p>

<p>“Duchess of Normandy,” said Thomas, “when is
Dicky Bill coming from town?”</p>

<p>“Dicky Bill is one of the stable boys,” explained Mr.
Bonstone.</p>

<p>The Duchess was scratching ten times in the snow
with her hoof.</p>

<p>“Hille ho, hille ho, hille ho,” sounded a sudden
ringing voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>We all turned, and there was Dicky Bill tearing
up the asphalt path from the electric car line.</p>

<p>He didn’t see us, and he rushed into the stable yard,
and threw his arm round the glossy neck of the Duchess&mdash;“Hello!
old girl.”</p>

<p>“Just look at that boy’s colour,” whispered Gringo,
“and six months ago, he was a washed-out rag.”</p>

<p>Dicky Bill was pulling at his cap in confusion. He
had just discovered Mr. Bonstone.</p>

<p>“You’ve made the Duchess tell a lie,” said Thomas.</p>

<p>“I told her I was coming back at ten,” said Dicky
Bill, “but I changed my mind. There’s nothin’ doin’
in town.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bonstone put up his hand to his face, to conceal
a smile. His plan was to make country life so interesting,
that town life seemed dull.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was speaking to Thomas. “You
gave that mare some sign, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“If I did, I didn’t know it,” said Thomas. “They
may get something I don’t get myself, for they watch
me closely. If I walk down by those stalls, and say
to myself, ‘That black mare is off her feed, I’ll give
her an extra ration of oats,’ she’ll whinny, and look
toward the oat bin.”</p>

<p>“My wife says,” remarked Mr. Bonstone, “that
when she gives a special feed of hemp to her hens, in
order to catch one, they’ll all eat out of her hand but
the one she has her mind on.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” said the old gentleman, “looks as if
we were the brutes, and the animals the reasoning beings&mdash;I’ll
have to catch my train&mdash;Thank you, my man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
I’m going to send you a book about the Elberfeld
horses.”</p>

<p>Gringo and I travelled slowly along after Mr. Bonstone
and his friends on their way to the house, but
stopped on the way to speak to Czarina, Yeggie,
Weary Winnie and the Frenchmen who had had their
early dinner, and were coming up to the stables for the
night.</p>

<p>As we were talking, the old gentleman and Mr.
Bonstone retraced their steps. They wanted to ask
something further about the horses from Thomas.</p>

<p>The gentleman paused to look at us. “What a
jolly lot of dogs,” he said&mdash;“they’re talking just as
we are. I wonder what they’re saying. Just look at
those intelligent faces. They understand us, but we
can’t understand them.”</p>

<p>We dogs all gave each other knowing glances.</p>

<p>“’Pon my word,” growled Gringo, “it seems as if
more human beings were beginning to find out that
we’re something more than lumps of flesh.”</p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said, “my leg is beginning to ache. I
must get home, but first I want to look in on your
family.”</p>

<p>“Good night, dogs,” we said to the stable bunch,
and we went on the way to the Bonstones’ big living-room,
where everybody gathered at this time of day.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Resterton sat in a corner by the fireplace,
knitting and talking to an old lady friend who had her
chair close beside hers. A nurse-maid was bringing in
Cyria and the twins from a frolic on the lawn, and
Master Carty, who had just arrived from town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
straight as a major, was helping his young nephew and
nieces to take off their wraps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonstone had just got out of her coupé at the
door. She had been calling on a neighbour, and pretty
soon she came in, smiling and holding out her hands
to the blaze. She greeted all her family in a loving
way, and did not forget to congratulate me on my restoration
to health.</p>

<p>“They’re all happy,” I said to Gringo, “now I must
skip home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” said Gringo. “We dogs have
all sworn that you’re to go nowhere without an escort.”</p>

<p>This amused me, and I tried to toss up my head
and show off a bit, as we ran out into the hall and
down the avenue. I could not, and had to go soberly.</p>

<p>“Will you come in, Gringo?” I said when I got
home.</p>

<p>“Certainty,” he said. “I’ll stay to dinner with you.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t taken aback. My kind mistress never objects
when I bring home a dog friend. Some women
are very fussy about entertaining.</p>

<p>We went into the library, where mistress was alone,
looking over the mail that lay on the big table. She
had been out walking, and still had on her warm coat
and cloth hat. She never wore furs now.</p>

<p>“Good dogs,” she said absently, “come close to the
fire,” and she went on reading a letter.</p>

<p>Gringo and I lay down on my hearth-stone, and
presently in came master from town.</p>

<p>He kissed his wife&mdash;“How rosy you look,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>She let the letter slip to the table.</p>

<p>“Do I?” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;this life in the country is a thousand times
better for you than the city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rudolph,” she said, “I met Stanna just now
in her coupé. Really, that woman is resplendent. She
looked like a tropical flower in a glass box. I wish I
were half as handsome.”</p>

<p>“Half as handsome,” repeated master in a kind of
innocent, wondering way. “Do you really think you
are not as good-looking as Stanna?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it,” said mistress almost impatiently,
“I know it.”</p>

<p>Master stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>Mistress burst out laughing. “I really believe, you
dear, foolish man, that you think I eclipse Stanna.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it, I know it,” he said decidedly.</p>

<p>“The boys in the street don’t stare after me as they
do after Stanna,” she said.</p>

<p>“That rejoices me,” he said gravely. “I shouldn’t
care to have them staring at you.”</p>

<p>Mistress broke into a delighted peal of laughter,
and I think was about to embrace him, but she wheeled
round and held out her arms to young George who
was entering the room, followed by Ellen and Beanie.</p>

<p>Beanie, in spite of a warm dog sweater he had on,
was shivering with cold and held his breast-bone so
close to the fire, that Gringo said gravely, “I smell you
scorching, Beans.”</p>

<p>He moved back a bit, and I said, “How you do feel
the cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too much F. F. V.,” said Gringo soberly.</p>

<p>“It does seem cold up here,” said Beanie, “after
that southern winter air.”</p>

<p>“Have you been to see Mrs. Waverlee?” asked
Gringo.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s fine,” said Beanie enthusiastically, “and
I love Patsie. Oh! dogs, we’re going to stay here.
I’m crazy with pleasure. I didn’t want to go back
to New York.”</p>

<p>We both congratulated him, then Ellen called him
to go upstairs, to have his sweater off.</p>

<p>Master and mistress went back to the topic of the
looks of ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Claudia,” master was saying, “if you were to tell
me that I wasn’t as handsome as Norman, I would
understand you.”</p>

<p>Mistress turned her back on him, and began to
gather up her mail from the table.</p>

<p>“No one would look at me twice, if Norman were
in the room,” said master. “He’s what I call a really
handsome man.”</p>

<p>“Look at Mrs. Granton’s shoulders shaking,” muttered
Gringo. “She thinks that’s a joke on my boss.”</p>

<p>Mistress turned round&mdash;her face perfectly convulsed
with amusement. “Rudolph,” she said, “you old
goose.”</p>

<p>“Gander,” corrected master. “Do the animal kingdom
justice.”</p>

<p>“Gander then,” said mistress. “Norman Bonstone
can’t be compared with you. You are the handsomest
man I ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Master gave her a quizzical smile. “It looks as
if we were both satisfied, doesn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p>“I am a very happy woman,” she said with emphasis.
“I used not to be. I am now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t much more to be added to that,” said Gringo,
as the two went arm in arm from the room. “It’s fine
to have all the bosses happy. Makes things easier
for us dogs&mdash;but who comes here?”</p>

<p>“Our unhappy ghost,” I said as Amarilla sneaked
into the room.</p>

<p>“How de do, dogsie,” said Gringo amiably. “Do
you think I am handsome?”</p>

<p>Amarilla hesitated, and looked at me in her timid
way.</p>

<p>“Weary Winnie and Reddy think I’m a beauty,”
said Gringo encouragingly, and with a hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re exactly pretty,” began Amarilla
shyly, then she stopped.</p>

<p>Gringo rolled over and over on the hearth-rug, in
his amusement. “Oh! Amarilla! Oh!” he said chokingly.</p>

<p>“Feel any happier to-day, girlie?” I asked as she
stretched herself out on the fender stool.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said cheerfully, “missie weighed me to-day
and I’m back to normal. Now you’re home, I’ve
nothing to fret about.”</p>

<p>“Human beings happy, dogs happy,” said Gringo,
“looks as if there was a green old age getting ripe for
us. Boy, I wish every animal in the world had as good
homes as we have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gringo,” I said enthusiastically, “that goes to my
heart. Happiness for everybody, say I.”</p>

<p>“Write it down,” said the good old dog. “You
know dog hearts pretty well. Say your say to the
human beings. Maybe you’ll make it easier for some
of the unhappy dogs.”</p>

<p>I took his remark to heart. I had already written
part of the story of my life, and for the other dogs’
sake, I, Boy of Pleasant River, give the rest of this
little sketch to the world.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
